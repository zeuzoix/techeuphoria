This journal assumes you are comfortable with a linux environment as most of the
published work here uses an Ubuntu distribution as the work station.

= Introduction

[partintro]
--
This journal was started in order to document my exploration of OpenWrt through
the prpl foundation.

== About prpl
== About OpenWrt

= Building OpenWrt

== Dependencies

The following is a list of packages that have to be installed in the system.
Each package has a brief description taken with the help of _apt-cache_:

. *build-essential* : Informational list of build-essential packages. If you
do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this package.  Starting
with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required for building Debian packages.
This package contains an informational list of packages which are considered
essential for building Debian packages.  This package also depends on the
packages on that list, to make it easy to have the build-essential packages
installed.
. *subversion* : Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version
control system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source code, 
websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and supports all the major
features of CVS, but has evolved to support many features that CVS users often
wish they had.
. *libncurses5-dev* : The ncurses library routines are a terminal-independent
method of updating character screens with reasonable optimization.This package
contains the header files, static libraries and symbolic links that developers
using ncurses will need.
. *zlib1g-dev* : Zlib compression library for development. zlib is a library
implementing the deflate compression method found in gzip and PKZIP. This
package includes the development support files.
. *gawk* : GNU awk, a pattern scanning and processing language `awk', a program
that you can use to select particular records in a file and perform operations
upon them.
. *gcc-multilib* : GNU C compiler (multilib files). This is the GNU C compiler,
a fairly portable optimizing compiler for C.
. *flex* : A fast lexical analyzer generator. Flex is a tool for generating
scanners: programs which recognized lexical patterns in text.
. *git-core* : A fast, scalable, distributed revision control system. Git is
popular version control system designed to handle very large projects with
speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile open source projects,
most notably the Linux kernel.
. *gettext* : GNU Internationalization utilities. Interesting for authors or
maintainers of other packages or programs which they want to see
internationalized.
. *qemu-system-mips* : QEMU full system emulation binaries (mips) QEMU is a
fast processor emulator: currently the package supports MIPS emulation. By
using dynamic translation it achieves reasonable speed while being easy to
port on new host CPUs.


=== Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies we use the apt-get command line application in a
terminal. The dependencies are installed as shown below.
 
[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk gcc-multilib flex git-core gettext qemu-system-mips
----

====
[[sudo-apt-get-install-dependencies]]
.Installing dependencies with sudo apt-get install
image::sudo-apt-get-install-dependencies.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/sudo-apt-get-install-dependencies.png]
====

The use of sudo is required to grant root priveledges to the apt-get command
while executing as changes will be made in the system directories. If you don't
have sudo access talk to your system administrator. Getting sudo access is a
matter of editing the /etc/sudoers file. For further information I suggest you
read about {uri-rootsudo}[RootSudo^] in the Ubuntu community pages.


=== Problems With Installation

While installing the above packages in my work station I encountered the
following errors which stopped the installation process

----
<1> Two recommendations provided by apt-get i.e. doing a system update OR
passing a _--fix-missing_ option to the command.


=== Solving The Installation Errors

In my case the first option of doing a system update helped. So the actual
steps that worker for my workstation are listed in the snippet below: 

[source,bash]

== Cloning The OpenWrt GIT Repository

Now that we have all the dependencies installed in the system it is time to
clone the repository. The OpenWrt project is maintained using
{uri-git-scm}[GIT^]. So change directory to the location where you would like
to keep the source code and clone the repository as follows:

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git$ git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git # <1>

<2> Clone completes without any errors

== Update OpenWrt Packages

Before we proceed to build the image for OpenWrt we have to run a package
update script which updates software that can be included in the OpenWrt
image.

The script checks the feed.conf.default file to get a list of all the
necessary packages to be updated

=== Break Up Of Update Process

The snippet below captures the steps that take place in order to update
the OpenWrt packages:

[source,bash]

== Configuring The System Image 

Before we can build the image that is booted up by our hardware or emulator
we need to configure the build for the right target system and also with 
the correct features that are required by the system when it runs. The
image is the Linux kernel along with a minimal file system which contains
the binary applications and libraries which will be essential for the 
applications running on the system.

The configuration process is similar to that of the Linxu kernel where we
run _make menuconfig_. The sections below will describe our various selections
along with appropriate screen shots and placeholders for the various options.
Additional features can be configured based on the requirements for the system.

=== Make Menuconfig

If you've installed the dependencies given above you should have no problem
running the _make menuconfig_ command. The execution of the _make menuconfig_
should be done in the OpenWrt directory.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/openwrt$ make menuconfig
----

On running make menuconfig in the OpenWrt
directory you should see a screen as shown below:

====
[[make-menuconfig-first-screen]]
.First screen seen after running make menuconfig
image::make-menuconfig-first-screen.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-first-screen.png]
====

=== Selecting The Target System

The first screen of the _make menuconfig_ command shows the cursor highlighting
the Target System. The target system selected is _Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx_. To
change the selection hit the enter key. There will be other targets present.
In our case we plan to run our built image on an emulator i.e. qemu for the 
MIPS Malta CoreLV board. Navigate the list of target options available using
the UP and DOWN arrow keys until the "MIPS Malta CoreLV board (qemu)" is
selected

====
[[make-menuconfig-mips-malta-corelv-qemu-target]]
.Selecting MIPS Malta CoreLV (qemu) as the target
image::make-menuconfig-mips-malta-corelv-qemu-target.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-mips-malta-corelv-qemu-target.png]
====

=== Selecting The Subtarget System

If your target selected has further subtargets then you will have to chose
an appropriate subtarget. The four subtargets available for MIPS Malta
CoreLV (qemu) are:

. Little Endian
. Big Endian
. Little Endian(64 bit)
. Big Endian(64 bit)

We keep the default i.e. Little Endian

====
[[make-menuconfig-little-endian-subtarget]]
.Selecting Little Endian as the subtarget
image::make-menuconfig-little-endian-subtarget.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-little-endian-subtarget.png]
====

=== Selecting The Target Profile

Once the subtarget is selected we have to visit the "Target Profile" section
and select an appropriate profile. If the target were set to "Lantiq" and
subtarget were set to "XWAY" we would get the a couple of options as target
profiles.

====
[[make-menuconfig-target-lantiq-subtarget-xway-profiles]]
.Profiles available if target is Lantiq and subtarget is XWAY
image::make-menuconfig-target-lantiq-subtarget-xway-profiles.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-target-lantiq-subtarget-xway-profiles.png]
====

However in our setup the target is "MIPS Malta CoreLV (qemu)" and the subtarget
is "Little Endian" and the only profile available is "Default". 

====
[[make-menuconfig-default-target-profile]]
.Selecting Default as the target profile for target "MIPS Malta CoreLV (qemu)" and subtarget "Little Endian"
image::make-menuconfig-default-target-profile.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-default-target-profile.png]
====

=== Selecting The Target Images

This option allows us to configure the way in which our system will boot. For
our qemu system a ramdisk is sufficient. Select "ramdisk" in the target images
submenu section. A ramdisk image is a compressed root file system image which
is bundled along with the linux kernel. The kernel loads the ramdisk image into
memory and starts the initialization scripts after mounting the root file system
from the loaded ramdisk image.

====
[[make-menuconfig-target-images-ramdisk]]
.Selecting ramdisk as the target image type
image::make-menuconfig-target-images-ramdisk.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-target-images-ramdisk.png]
====

Hitting enter will select ramdisk from the submenu and will take us to a
submenu for ramdisk which will allow us to configure the type of ramdisk.
Below we see that the type of compression is set to none. This can be changed
by selecting the compression option and choosing the type of compression desired.

====
[[make-menuconfig-ramdisk-submenu]]
.Selecting ramdisk gives us configuration options for the ramdisk
image::make-menuconfig-ramdisk-submenu.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-ramdisk-submenu.png]
====

The following is the list of compression types available. We keep the
compression as none for now.

. none
. gzip
. bzip2
. lzma
. lzo
. lz4
. xz

====
[[make-menuconfig-ramdisk-compression-submenu]]
.Selecting compression gives us a list of different compression types
image::make-menuconfig-ramdisk-compression-submenu.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-ramdisk-compression-submenu.png]
====

We will Exit all submenus as we don't want to change the ramdisk settings.

=== Selecting Advanced Configuration Options

The advanced configuration options changes the build process of OpenWrt. This
option is available in a checkbox and must first be selected before any
configuration options can be made available. To do so after highlighting the 
advanced configuration options we have to hit the spacebar key. This will
toggle the selection. 

====
[[make-menuconfig-selecting-advanced-configuration-options]]
.Selecting advanced configuration options with the spacebar key
image::make-menuconfig-selecting-advanced-configuration-options.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-selecting-advanced-configuration-options.png]
====
Next hit the enter key to open the submenu of the advanced configuration
options. In our example we have to bypass a bug in the version of Qemu included
as part of the Ubuntu 14.04 configuration. Go to the "Target Options" menu by
pressing the down key and hit the spacebar key to select the item.

====
[[make-menuconfig-advanced-configuration-target-options]]
.Selecting target options in advanced configuration options with the spacebar key
image::make-menuconfig-advanced-configuration-target-options.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-advanced-configuration-target-options.png]
====

Hit the enter key to open the submenu of the target options. Go down and toggle
the "Build packages with MIPS16 instructions" off.

====
[[make-menuconfig-toggle-build-packages-with-mips16-instructions-off]]
.Toggling build packages with mips16 instructions off
image::make-menuconfig-toggle-build-packages-with-mips16-instructions-off.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-toggle-build-packages-with-mips16-instructions-off.png]
====

=== Selecting Included Software Packages

It is possible to select the software packages that included as part of the
build of the image. We can select each of the following to see what gets
built and packaged in the system.

. Base Systems
. Boot Loaders
. Development
. Firmware
. Kernel modules
. Languages
. Libraries
. Network
. Utilities

====
[[make-menuconfig-selecting-included-software-packages]]
.Selecting included software packages
image::make-menuconfig-selecting-included-software-packages.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-selecting-included-software-packages.png]
====

For instance if we wanted to include debugging utilities like binutils or
gdbserver we should select the Development option.

====
[[make-menuconfig-selecting-development-tools]]
.Selecting development tools
image::make-menuconfig-selecting-development-tools.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-selecting-development-tools.png]
====

=== Saving The Configuration

After making all the changes required in the configuration setup we have to
exit and savethe settings. This is done by simply navigating to the "Exit"
option and hitting the enter key. We get a prompt asking if we want to save
the new configuration. 

====
[[make-menuconfig-confirmation-to-save-new-config]]
.Confirmation prompt asking if we want to save the configuration
image::make-menuconfig-confirmation-to-save-new-config.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/make-menuconfig-confirmation-to-save-new-config.png]
====

By default the "Yes" option is selected and if we hit the enter key it saves
the settings to a _.config_ file. If we need to make additional changes we can
hit the escape key to go back to the menuconfig. At the end after hitting
the enter key and saving the configuration we get the following message on the
terminal.

[source,bash]
