This journal assumes you are comfortable with a linux environment as most of the
published work here uses an Ubuntu distribution as the work station.

= Introduction

[partintro]
--
This journal was started in order to document my exploration of OpenWrt through
the prpl foundation.

== About prpl

= Building OpenWrt

== Dependencies

The following is a list of packages that have to be installed in the system.
Each package has a brief description taken with the help of _apt-cache_:

. *build-essential* : Informational list of build-essential packages. If you
do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this package.  Starting
with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required for building Debian packages.
This package contains an informational list of packages which are considered
essential for building Debian packages.  This package also depends on the
packages on that list, to make it easy to have the build-essential packages
installed.
. *subversion* : Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version
control system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source code, 
websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and supports all the major
features of CVS, but has evolved to support many features that CVS users often
wish they had.
. *libncurses5-dev* : The ncurses library routines are a terminal-independent
method of updating character screens with reasonable optimization.This package
contains the header files, static libraries and symbolic links that developers
using ncurses will need.
. *zlib1g-dev* : Zlib compression library for development. zlib is a library
implementing the deflate compression method found in gzip and PKZIP. This
package includes the development support files.
. *gawk* : GNU awk, a pattern scanning and processing language `awk', a program
that you can use to select particular records in a file and perform operations
upon them.
. *gcc-multilib* : GNU C compiler (multilib files). This is the GNU C compiler,
a fairly portable optimizing compiler for C.
. *flex* : A fast lexical analyzer generator. Flex is a tool for generating
scanners: programs which recognized lexical patterns in text.
. *git-core* : A fast, scalable, distributed revision control system. Git is
popular version control system designed to handle very large projects with
speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile open source projects,
most notably the Linux kernel.
. *gettext* : GNU Internationalization utilities. Interesting for authors or
maintainers of other packages or programs which they want to see
internationalized.
. *qemu-system-mips* : QEMU full system emulation binaries (mips) QEMU is a
fast processor emulator: currently the package supports MIPS emulation. By
using dynamic translation it achieves reasonable speed while being easy to
port on new host CPUs.


=== Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies we use the apt-get command line application in a
terminal. The dependencies are installed as shown below.
 
[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk gcc-multilib flex git-core gettext qemu-system-mips
----

====
[[sudo-apt-get-install-dependencies]]
.Installing dependencies with sudo apt-get install
image::sudo-apt-get-install-dependencies.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/sudo-apt-get-install-dependencies.png]
====

The use of sudo is required to grant root priveledges to the apt-get command
while executing as changes will be made in the system directories. If you don't
have sudo access talk to your system administrator. Getting sudo access is a
matter of editing the /etc/sudoers file. For further information I suggest you
read about {uri-rootsudo}[RootSudo^] in the Ubuntu community pages.


=== Problems with installation

While installing the above packages in my work station I encountered the
following errors which stopped the installation process

----
<1> Two recommendations provided by apt-get i.e. doing a system update OR
passing a _--fix-missing_ option to the command.


=== Solving the installation errors

In my case the first option of doing a system update helped. So the actual
steps that worker for my workstation are listed in the snippet below: 

[source,bash]
----

== Cloning the OpenWrt GIT Repository

Now that we have all the dependencies installed in the system it is time to
clone the repository. The OpenWrt project is maintained using
{uri-git-scm}[GIT^]. So change directory to the location where you would like
to keep the source code and clone the repository as follows:

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git$ git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git # <1>
