== Advantages Of GPL Drivers

. It is possible to reuse software from other GPL drivers to write a new GPL
driver

. A GPL driver has more contributors, testers, reviewers and maintainers
thereby making it more robust.

. Once the driver is accepted it is easily shipped and distributed by
others who are using the Linux Kernel.

. A pre-compiled driver will always have to catch up with the latest kernel
devlopments leaving users of the driver at a loss as they can't upgrade
their kernel with ease in order to use the latest source with new features

. Making a driver GPL compliant avoids any potential legal hastles
