== Compiling The Kernel

After configuring the kernel with one of the configuration interfaces we can
proceed to build the kernel by issuing a _make_ command in the root directory.
If blessed with multiple CPU cores then the build can be speed up using a
_make -j 4_ command which instructs make to run 4 jobs in parallel.

After the build the following will be generated:

vmlinux:: Raw and uncompressed image which can be used for debugging purposes.
This image cannot be booted.
arch/<ARCH>/boot/*Image:: The final kernel image which can be booted e.g.
bzImage for x86 and zImage for ARM. There may also be compressed images
generated.
arch/<ARCH>/boot/dts/*.dtb:: Compiled Device Tree files for certain
architectures. This will be loaded by the bootloader before the kernel image.
kernel modules(*.ko):: This will be generated in the directory corresponding
to the driver/feature for which module type of configuration option was
selected.
