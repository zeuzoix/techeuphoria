== LAB 3 : Cross Compiling The Kernel And Booting It From The Workstation

[NOTE]
.This is a hands on session taken from the Free Electrons labs with the following objectives
====
. Cross-compile the Linux kernel for the ARM platform
. Boot the cross-compiled kernel with a NFS root filesystem, using the workstation as a NFS
server
====

=== Enabling Networking To Speed Up Embedded Development

In the previous lab we enabled network connectivity between the board and
workstation by configuring the U-Boot environment appropriately. This
enables us to build our binaries on the workstation and test it on the
board without having to flash the board which saves time as well
as prolongs the life of the eMMC device or micro-SD card. We will also
enable a NFS type of root filesystem which will allow us to test
cross-compiled modules on board.

=== Installing The Prerequisites

We will need to install a couple of packages before we can proceed with the lab.

[source,bash]

for mkuimage
<2> gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi is the cross compiler toolchain from Linaro
<3> Path and name of the cross-compiler can be determined by examining the
cross-compiler installed.


=== Configuring The Kernel

We start with configuring the kernel source code with a default configuration.
Since our board has a processor(AM335x) which belongs to the OMAP2 family we
will use a default configuration file for that board i.e. omap2plus_defconfig.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ find arch/arm/configs/ -iname '*omap*'
arch/arm/configs/omap2plus_defconfig	<1>
arch/arm/configs/omap1_defconfig
arch/arm/configs/da8xx_omapl_defconfig
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- omap2plus_defconfig	<2>
#
# configuration written to .config
#
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$
----
<1> The default configuration for omap2 boards
<2> Setting the default configuration to omap2dplus_defconfig

Now configure the kernel to use a NFS root filesystem. This can be done with
any of the configuration targets i.e. menuconfig, nconfig, gconfig or xconfig.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- menuconfig
scripts/kconfig/mconf Kconfig
.
.
----

To identify the configuration option for NFS root filesystem search for
_CONFIG_ROOT_NFS_ once the menuconfig screen appears.

=== Cross-compiling The Kernel

Now it is time to cross-compile the kernel after we have configured it
correctly. We will first do a clean on the source code to make sure we're
compiling fresh

==== Clean The Sources

[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- clean
  CLEAN   .
  CLEAN   arch/arm/kernel
  CLEAN   drivers/eisa
  CLEAN   drivers/gpu/drm/radeon
  CLEAN   drivers/net/wan
  CLEAN   drivers/scsi/aic7xxx
  CLEAN   drivers/scsi
  CLEAN   drivers/tty/vt
  CLEAN   drivers/video/logo
  CLEAN   firmware
  CLEAN   kernel/debug/kdb
  CLEAN   kernel
  CLEAN   lib/raid6
  CLEAN   lib
  CLEAN   security/apparmor
  CLEAN   security/selinux
  CLEAN   usr
  CLEAN   arch/arm/boot/compressed
  CLEAN   arch/arm/boot/dts
  CLEAN   arch/arm/boot
  CLEAN   .tmp_versions
----

We compile the source code by invoking make with no target and by passing
ARCH as _arm_ and CROSS_COMPILE as _arm-linux-gnueabi-_. The compilation
process may take a while. 

==== Build zImage

<1> The cross-compilation command in the kernel source directory
<2> The zImage generated after cross-compilation
<3> We check the type of file of zImage using the _file_ command

==== Build uImage

In order to boot the kernel image with U-Boot we need to convert it into
a special format called _uImage_. The kernel Makefile has a target that can do
this and which uses _mkimage_ tool found in the u-boot-tools package. The file
will contain the zImage kernel and information about load address of the
kernel. The load address will vary based on the platform for the BeagleBone
Black board it is 0x80008000.

[source, bash]
----

==== Generate The Device Tree Binaries

We also need to generate the Device Tree Binaries (DTBs)
[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make dtbs
----

==== Copy To TFTP Server Home Directory

Finally we can copy the _uImage_ and the _am335x-boneblack.dtb_ files to the
TFTP server home directory i.e. _/var/lib/tftpboot_.

[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ cp arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-boneblack.dtb /var/lib/tftpboot/.
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ cp arch/arm/boot/uImage /var/lib/tftpboot/.
----

=== Setting Up The NFS Server

We will now need to setup our workstation as a NFS server. This will require
installation of the _nfs-kernel-server_ package.

[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/fe-kernel-training$ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
----

Once installed we need to edit the _/etc/exports_ file to configure the server
to allow a NFS client to connect to it and mount a directory. In this case
we want to configure the NFS server in such a way so as to allow our
BeagleBone Black platform to mount the root filesystem which is there in our
workstation lab data directory.

[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/fe-kernel-training$ cat /etc/exports 		<1>
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#		to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/home/conrad/fe-kernel-training/linux-kernel-labs/modules/nfsroot 192.168.0.100(rw,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)	<2>
----
<1> After editing the file we cat its contents
<2> The directory of nfsroot is exported to IP 192.168.0.100 which is our BBB IP

Finally before we boot make sure to restart the NFS server as shown below. If
there are any errors then the server will refuse to start and error logs will
appear. The _/etc/exports_ file must be revisited and the syntax of the line
must be inspected and corrected. Fix the errors and ensure the NFS server
restarts before proceeding.
[source, bash]
----

=== Boot The System

We will now proceed to boot the system. Make sure the BeagleBone Black is
connected to the USB to serial connector correctly as was described in
Lab2. Also make sure your etherned cable is connected between the board
and your workstation. On powering up the board interrupt the boot sequence
so that we have access to the U-Boot console.

==== Setting The _bootargs_

We will now change the _bootargs_ environment variable to instruct it to
boot the root filesystem from a NFS server and also we will pass the
consoled that it is to use. These are standard kernel parameters which
can change the way the kernel boots the system.

[source, bash]

U-Boot# 
----
<1> We use setenv to fix the _bootargs_.

==== Explanation Of The Bootargs

root=/dev/nfs:: We set the root filesystem device as /dev/nfs to indicate that
NFS is to be used.
rw::The root filesystem should be mounted with read and write capabilities
ip=192.168.0.100:: The IP of the BeagleBone Black board should be 192.168.0.100
before mounting the NFS root filesystem
console=ttyO0:: The console to be used is serial port 0. The character before
the 0 is 'O' as in "OMAP".
nfsroot=192.168.0.1:/home/conrad/fe-kernel-training/linux-kernel-labs/modules/nfsroot:: The
NFS root filesystem server IP and path of the directory. This is similar to
the workstation settings. The IP is the workstation ethernet static IP and
the path is the same as that in the _/etc/exports_.

==== Download The Kernel Image And Device Tree Binary

The first step is to download the _uImage_ via _tftp_. Before downloading it
is good to restart the TFTP server on the workstation.

[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/fe-kernel-training$ sudo service tftpd-hpa restart
tftpd-hpa stop/waiting
tftpd-hpa start/running, process 4204
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/fe-kernel-training$ 
----

Next on the U-Boot console we can download the uImage as we learnt in the previous lab.
We download it to address 0x81000000.

[source, bash]
----
U-Boot# tftp 0x81000000 uImage				<1>

Next we download the device tree binary for the BeagleBone Black board to 
address 0x82000000

----
<1> Command to download _am335x-boneblack.dtb_
<2> 17911 bytes successfully transferred.

==== Boot The Kernel

Finally we can boot the kernel from the U-Boot prompt passing the address
of the _uImage_ and the address of the device tree binary. The complete log
file is available {link-lab3-kernel-boot}[here^]. The credentials for the
login prompt are username as _root_ and no password.

[source, bash]
----

<2>
include::lab3-kernel-boot.adoc[tags=nfs_mount_start]
----
<1> Successfully starting the kernel
<2> The NFS root filesystem has been successfully mounted giving us access to a root terminal.

If at all the kernel fails to mount the NFS root filesystem take a look
at the _/var/log/syslog_ file.

==== Automating The Boot System

It is cumbersome to repeat the sequence of U-Boot commands at the console
everytime we want to boot our system. We can automate the boot process by
changing the _bootcmd_ environment variable of U-Boot. Before doing so we
can save the older value of _bootcmd_ in another variable of our choice.
Reset the board by pressing the "Reset" switch. Interrupt the U-Boot
autoprompt sequence to gain access to the U-Boot terminal.

[source, bash]
----
U-Boot# printenv bootcmd	<1>
bootcmd=run findfdt; run mmcboot;setenv mmcdev 1; setenv bootpart 1:2; run mmcboot;run nandboot;
U-Boot# 
U-Boot# setenv bootcmd_orig 'run findfdt; run mmcboot;setenv mmcdev 1; setenv bootpart 1:2; run mmcboot;run nandboot;'	<2>

U-Boot# printenv bootcmd
bootcmd=tftp 0x81000000 uImage; tftp 0x82000000 am335x-boneblack.dtb; bootm 0x81000000 - 0x82000000
U-Boot# saveenv			<4>

----
<1> Checking the value of _bootcmd_
<2> Note the use of single quotes for the value of the command
<3> Setting the new value of _bootcmd_
<4> Saving the environment changes

The _bootcmd_ can be changed based on requirements. It can also be changed to
boot the _uImage_ from the eMMC flash if it is stored there. As a last step
power cycle the board to check if the system boots up as was done previously.
If there is an issue in the boot sequence then review the _bootcmd_ carefully.

==== Halting The Sytem And Disconnecting Picocom

We have to remember that the BeagleBone Black is a development board which
may not be as robust as other products. To be on the safer side it is good
to shutdown the system correctly. To shutdown the system we can issue the
_halt_ command in the terminal.

[source, bash]
----
buildroot login: root
# 
# 
# halt					<1>
The system is going down NOW!
Sent SIGTERM to all processes
Sent SIGKILL to all processes
Requesting system halt
[  202.908940] reboot: System halted	<2>
----
<1> On issuing _halt_ wait for the system to shutdown
<2> The last log received

Finally _picocom_ can be disengaged carefully by keying the
"espace character" which by default is "C-a" and then by hitting
"x".
