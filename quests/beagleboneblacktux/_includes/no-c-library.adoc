== No C Library

The Linux Kernel is a single program which has its own routines to perform
common functions. It does not use any user space library like stdlib, rather
it has equivalent functions that enable it to achieve the same results.

In place of the standard C functions like printf(), memset(), malloc() there
are functions like printk(), memset(),kmalloc() in the source code.
