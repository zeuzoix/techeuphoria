== LAB 2 : Setting Up The Beaglebone Black Board

[NOTE]
.This is a hands on session taken from the Free Electrons labs with the following objectives
====
. Getting familiar with the BeagleBone Black board
. Knowing what technical documentation is available
. Installing the lab data from Free Electrons
. Access the board through the serial line. 
. Configure the U-boot bootloader to download files onto the board using trivial
file transfer protocol (tftp)
====

=== Getting Comfortable With The Board

At this point we have to get familiar with our board. It is good to go through
the features of the board given in section 4.0 of the
{link-beagleboneblack-srm-pdf}[BeagleBone Black System Reference Manual^].

==== Connectors, LEDs and Switches

====

====

5V DC Power Connector:: The main DC input which accepts 5V power. Suitable for
more power hungry applications.
Power Down Button Switch:: Signals to the processor to initiate the power down
sequence. It is used to power down the board.
Boot Button Switch:: Force the a boot from the micro-SD card by removing and
reapplying power to the board.
Reset Button Switch:: Reset the processor.
USB Client Connector:: Mini USB port at the bottom of the board. It can be
used to power the board and setup a network connection.
10/100 Ethernet Connector:: The LAN interface.
Debug Serial Header Connector:: The header interface for the serial port.
MicroSD Slot Connector:: Slot at the bottom of the board to insert a micro-SD
card.
MicroHDMI Slot Connector:: Slot at the bottom of the board to insert a
micro-HDMI cable to interface to a display.
USB Host Connector:: This can be used to connect a USB device like keyboard,
mouse, BT dongle, WiFi dongle, etc..

==== System Key Components

.BeagleBone Black system key components
image::COMP_A5A.jpg[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/COMP_A5A.jpg]
====

Sitara Processor:: ARM architecture OMAP System On Chip(SOC) from
Texas Instruments. This is XAM3359AZCZ100 for revision A5A to A6A and
XAM3359AZCZ100 for revision B and above. Only the A4 revision boards had the
AM3352 processor.
512MB DDR3 RAM:: Micron 512MB DDR3L or Kingston 512MB DDR3 Dual Data Rate RAM.
TPS65217C PMIC:: It is the power management IC which supplies the power rails
to the different components on board.
SMSC Ethernet PHY:: The physical interface to the ethernet network.
Micron eMMC:: This was 2GB till revision B and changed to 4GB in revision C.
HDMI Framer:: Provides the HDMI control for and HDMI or DVI-D display with
adaptor.

=== Downloading The Technical Documentation

Design is not possible without documentation, so we download the documents
which will help us in the lab sessions. The following are needed:


Tht System Reference Manual describes the details about the design of the
board and is available on this site {link-beagleboneblack-srm-pdf}[here^] +
The latest document should be available at: {uri-beagleboneblack-srm}[{uri-beagleboneblack-srm}^].
 

The datasheet of the TI AM335x SoCs is useful to see the PIN assignments
later when we want to configure the _pinmux_ settings and is available on this
site {link-am3359-datasheet-pdf}[here^] +
The original link is at the TI website at: {uri-am3359-datasheet}[{uri-am3359-datasheet}^]

The last document is the Technical Reference Manual(TRM) of the TI AM335x SoCs.
At over 4000 pages it describes the internal IP design of the chip. It is available
{link-am3358-technical-reference-manual-pdf}[here^]. +
The same document can be retrieved from the TI website at :
{uri-am3358-technical-reference-manual}[{uri-am3358-technical-reference-manual}^]
  
=== Installing The Free Electrons Lab Data

We will be using the lab data available from Free Electrons to setup our
BeagleBone Black. First make sure the lab data is downloaded. The lab data which
was available at the time of writing this journal is
{link-fe-linux-kernel-labs-tar-xz}[here^].

We'll have to uncompress the file with *sudo* permissions and change the
permissions of the resulting folder. The prime reason being that the package
contains system device node files for the NFS root filesystem:

[source,bash]

=== Making A Bootable MicroSD Card

Now we deviate slightly from the Free Electrons lab slides and first
prepare our board as per the instructions provided in the
_linux-kernel-labs/bootloader/beaglebone-black/README.txt_ file. The
bootable micro-SD card will automatically format the on board eMMC
device.

Take the micro-SD card and insert it into a micro-SD adapter/reader
like the one shown in the image below:

====
[[beagleboneblacktux-microsd-adaptor-sd]]
.Micro SD card adapter
image::sdcard-microsd-adaptor-sd.jpg[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/sdcard-microsd-adaptor-sd.jpg]
====
 
This memory card reader/adapter should be inserted into the SD card
slot available. If your system has a micro-SD card slot then please
use that directly. On checking the kernel logs with _dmesg_ we should
be able to identify the card detected in the system. If a micro-SD
card slot is available then the system should register it as a 
_/dev/mmcblk0_ whereas in this case with a memory card reader we see
it as _/dev/sdb_. The following shows the kernel logs:

This tool helps us to list the partitions of a device, check the sizes of the
partitions, check the partitions on a device and re-partition a device. We must
*be extra careful* when we use such a tool as it could also cause damage to our
workstation system if we select the wrong device file unintentionally.

====

We can now safely eject or remove the micro-SD card from the work station.

==== Source For Binaries

The binaries that are copied can be built from source however we're not
going to do that for now. Instructions to build them are given in the
_linux-kernel-labs/bootloader/beaglebone-black/README.txt_ of the lab data
downloaded.

=== Reflashing The eMMC With The micro-SD Card

The bootable micro-SD card will now be used to reflash the eMMC device to get
it ready for the lab session. The process is short but the steps maybe a bit
confusing so follow the pictures to nail it down correctly.

==== Insert The micro-SD Card

This step is self-explanatory. The bootable micro-SD card has to be inserted
into the micro-SD card slot on the BeagleBone Black board. The micro-SD card
has 8 contacts with a golden hue which are at the bottom of the card. The
picture below shows the top of the micro-SD card which is placed in the slot.
All that is left is to press it into the slot until a click is felt.

====

image::beagleboneblacktux-microsd-in-slot.jpg[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/beagleboneblacktux-microsd-in-slot.jpg]
====

==== Pressing The Boot Switch

After inserting the micro-SD card we have to press the boot switch which is
located near the micro-SD card slot as shown in the picture below. Also note
that the micro-SD card has been inserted properly into its slot.

====

image::beagleboneblacktux-boot-switch-pressed.jpg[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/beagleboneblacktux-boot-switch-pressed.jpg]
====

==== Applying Power

The last step is to apply power i.e. either through the USB connector or
power connector. Make sure your power supply is built for 5V 1A output
before inserting it into the power supply connector. You can depress the
boot switch after 1 second after applying power. On applying power the
leds will start blinking. The entire reflashing process takes about 20 to
30 seconds. At the end of the process all 4 leds will be on as shown:

====
[[beagleboneblacktux-all-leds-on-successful-reflash]]
.The reflash operation was successful as all 4 leds are on after 20s

====

==== Troubleshooting

In case there is an issue with the process and the 4 leds do not light up
after a minute then try again. If it still fails then go through the steps
given in the lab data folder i.e.
_linux-kernel-labs/bootloader/beaglebone-black/README.txt_. The
procedure given here has been taken from that document. There's a section
on "Fixing issues (if any)" which might help.

=== Setting Up Serial Communication With The Board
	
The debug serial header connector has been descibed in the 
<<Getting Comfortable With The Board>> section and should be easy to locate
 with the labelled image in that section. It is a 1x6 header. Serial
capability is provided by UART0 of the processor. It would be good to read
the section on the debug serial header given in the
{link-am3358-technical-reference-manual-pdf}[Technical Reference Manual^].

The only two signals available are TX and RX on the connector and the levels
on these signals is 3.3V. A FTDI USB to serial cable is recommended as this
serves to provide a serial port to PCs/Laptops making use of the available
USB port. The FTDI chip translates the USB data to serial and vice versa. There
are several provided in the elinux.org website link at: +
{link-elinux-bbb-serial-ftdi}[{link-elinux-bbb-serial-ftdi}^].

==== Rhydolabz FTDI USB To Serial Breakout Board

In this journal a breakout board was purchased from
{link-rhydolabz-home-page}[Rhydolabz^]. There are several boards available but
one without a 1x6 connector was chosen. All the signals of the FTDI can be
exposed by soldering a bergstrip pin-out for advanced users but for our use
case GND, RX and TX are provided with an easy to access 4 pin connector. The
board is also capable of outputing both 5V and 3.3V. This is controlled by
soldering the 3.3V leads at the back of the breakout board. The board can be
picked up from: +
{link-rhydolabz-ftdi-usb-to-serial-converter}[{link-rhydolabz-ftdi-usb-to-serial-converter}^]

====

==== Connecting The Breakout Board

The FTDI breakout board comes with a Grove 4 pin Female jumper to 4 pin
conversion cable. Each of the cables can be connected to female connectors
to be slotted into the serial debug header pins. We need only the GND, RXD
and TXD signals from the board. Before connecting the board signals make
sure the 3.3V leads are shorted at the bottom of the board. The board from
Rhydolabz comes with the 5V lead shorted and must be converted for the Beagle
Bone Black.

. Connect the GND cable of the FTDI breakout board to pin 1 of the serial header.
. Next connect RXD of the FTDI breakout board to pin 5 which is the TX of the serial debug header.
. Finally connect TXD of the board to pin 4 which is the RX of the serial debug header.

It is always good to understand the specifications of the connectors whenever
interfacing electronic circuits. In this case we know that the BeagleBone Black
takes 3.3V from the System Reference Manual. If a different cable is to be used
check and see if its connector is compatible with the header. The figure below
shows the setup where GND is the orange cable on the right, next RXD is the
brown cable followed by the TXD which is the red cable.

====

Once the connections are in place between the BeagleBone Black serial debug
header and the FTDI cable or breakout board then connect the USB cable to the
breakout board. The picture shows that the board lights up.

The linux kernel running on the workstation should register the new USB
device connected. We can probe the kernel logs to see if there is any activity
using dmesg.

<2> A device node _/dev/ttyUSB0_ is created in the root filesystem

==== Accessing The Serial Port With _Picocom_

We can now access the serial port with a terminal application like picocom.
This can be installed as follows:
[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/fe-kernel-training/linux-kernel-labs$ sudo apt-get install picocom	<1>
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/fe-kernel-training/linux-kernel-labs$ sudo adduser $USER dialout	<2>
----
<1> Installing _picocom_ with _apt-get_
<2> Adding $USER to the dialout group to use _picocom_ without sudo. $USER is set to the username i.e conrad in the above case.

We can now start _picocom_ and connect it to the _/dev/ttyUSB0_ device which
was created earlier. The baud rate is specified with the -b option. The
default serial port settings for the board are:

. Baud 115,200
. Bits 8
. Parity N
. Stop Bits 1
. Handshake None

After starting the _picocom_ application we should be able to see the serial
port is opened and the settings should be the default settings. If they are
not then try to get the settings by providing options to picocom. Once we get
the desired settings we can apply power to the connected BeagleBone Black. At
this point we will boot up the board for the first time and should see the
serial logs of the bootloader U-Boot. The boot process can be interrupted by
hitting any key on the keyboard and allowing us to configure the U-Boot 
environment.

[source,bash]
----

==== Setting Default Environment Variables For U-Boot

We need to make sure the version of the U-Boot running is 2013.10. We use the
command _version_ to get the information.

[source,bash]
----
U-Boot#     version	<1>

U-Boot 2013.10 (Nov 28 2013 - 06:36:11)		<2>

----
<1> _version_ checks the version of U-Boot in the system 
<2> Our version has to be 2013.10 to save the U-Boot environment to the eMMC storage

Finally we reset the settings of the U-Boot environment to its default values using
the command _env default -f -a_ as shown below. Finally _saveenv_ is used to save
the environment settings whenever we want to retain it across reboots.

[source,bash]
----

=== Setting Up Ethernet Communication With The Board

We will now need to setup the board in such a way so as to allow us to download
files to its system memory using U-Boot. To do this we will use Trivial File
Transfer Protocol (TFTP) through an ethernet cable. Our board will be the TFTP
client and we will configure our Ubuntu work station to act as a TFTP server.
TFTP can be installed as shown below using APT.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/fe-kernel-training$ sudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa
----

Now we will connect an ethernet cable between our workstation and the BeagleBone
Black ethernet connector. If the workstation does not have any more connections
then we will have to use a USB ethernet adapter. In this case we have an unused
connection so we will connect the cable as shown.

====

We next have to configure the network interface on the workstation side. Click
on the network manager tasklet on the desktop and select _Edit Connections_.

====

Edit the new ethernet connection by changing its name to _BBB_. Change the
IPV4 settings by selecting the method as manual. And finally add the static
address as 192.168.0.1 and netmask as 255.255.255.0. There's no need to add
a gateway but if the cursor is in the textbox enter 0.0.0.0. Save the
settings and the interface is set up on the workstation.
