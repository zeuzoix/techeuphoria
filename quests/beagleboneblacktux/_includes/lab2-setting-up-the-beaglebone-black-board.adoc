== LAB 2 : Setting Up The Beaglebone Black Board

[NOTE]
.This is a hands on session taken from the Free Electrons labs with the following objectives
====
. Access the board through the serial line. 
. Configure the U-boot bootloader to download files onto the board using trivial
file transfer protocol (tftp)
====

=== Getting Comfortable With The Board

At this point we have to get familiar with our board. It is good to go through
the features of the board given in section 4.0 of the
{link-beagleboneblack-srm-pdf}[BeagleBone Black System Reference Manual^].

==== Connectors, LEDs and Switches

====

5V DC Power Connector:: The main DC input which accepts 5V power. Suitable for
more power hungry applications.
Power Down Button Switch:: Signals to the processor to initiate the power down
sequence. It is used to power down the board.
Boot Button Switch:: Force the a boot from the microSD card by removing and
reapplying power to the board.
Reset Button Switch:: Reset the processor.
USB Client Connector:: Mini USB port at the bottom of the board. It can be
used to power the board and setup a network connection.
10/100 Ethernet Connector:: The LAN interface.
Debug Serial Header Connector:: The header interface for the serial port.
MicroSD Slot Connector:: Slot at the bottom of the board to insert a micro SD
card.
MicroHDMI Slot Connector:: Slot at the bottom of the board to insert a micro
HDMI cable to interface to a display.
USB Host Connector:: This can be used to connect a USB device like keyboard,
mouse, BT dongle, WiFi dongle, etc..

==== System Key Components

====

Sitara Processor:: ARM architecture OMAP System On Chip(SOC) from
Texas Instruments. This is XAM3359AZCZ100 for revision A5A to A6A and
XAM3359AZCZ100 for revision B and above. Only the A4 revision boards had the
AM3352 processor.
512MB DDR3 RAM:: Micron 512MB DDR3L or Kingston 512MB DDR3 Dual Data Rate RAM.
TPS65217C PMIC:: It is the power management IC which supplies the power rails
to the different components on board.
SMSC Ethernet PHY:: The physical interface to the ethernet network.
Micron eMMC:: This was 2GB till revision B and changed to 4GB in revision C.
HDMI Framer:: Provides the HDMI control for and HDMI or DVI-D display with
adaptor.

=== Downloading The Technical Documentation

Design is not possible without documentation, so we download the documents
which will help us in the lab sessions. The following are needed:


Tht System Reference Manual describes the details about the design of the
board and is available on this site at: {link-beagleboneblack-srm-pdf}[{link-beagleboneblack-srm-pdf}^] +
The latest document should be available at: {link-beagleboneblack-srm}[{link-beagleboneblack-srm}^].
 

The datasheet of the TI AM335x SoCs is useful to see the PIN assignments
later when we want to configure the _pinmux_ settings and is available on this
site at: {link-am3359-datasheet-pdf}[{link-am3359-datasheet-pdf}^] +
The original link is at the TI website at: {link-am3359-datasheet}[{link-am3359-datasheet}^]

The last document is the Technical Reference Manual(TRM) of the TI AM335x SoCs.
At over 4000 pages it describes the internal IP design of the chip. It is available
at: {link-am3358-technical-reference-manual-pdf}[{link-am3358-technical-reference-manual-pdf}^]. +
