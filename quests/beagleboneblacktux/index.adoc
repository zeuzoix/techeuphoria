This journal assumes you are comfortable with a linux environment as most of the
published work here uses an Ubuntu distribution as the work station.


= Introduction

[partintro]
--
This journal was started in order to document my exploration of embedded linux
using a popular low-cost platform i.e. the BeagleBone Black. The end objective 
is to become well versed with embedded linux development on an ARM based embedded
device.

== About Free Electrons
{uri-free-electrons}[Free Electrons^] is an engineering company consisting of
embedded linux experts who support companies using Embedded Linux. They 
additionally conduct training workshops for companies on different topics 
such as Linux kernel and device driver development, Android system development, 
Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded development, etc. This journal uses the Free 
Electrons training material which they publish online to explore Embedded Linux
with the BeagleBone Black board from TI.

== About BeagleBoard
{uri-beagleboard}[BeagleBoard.org Foundation^] is a non-profit corporation which
promotes open source software and open hardware. It was started by enthusiasts
from TI with the aim of providing a powerful platform to design embedded solutions.
The BeagleBone Black is their fourth board till date which offers a lot of 
possibilities in a small credit card size form factor.

This section covers the setup software and hardware used in this journal.
The sources of the training material and references are mentioned as well
as details about how to procure the hardware.

== Hardware

=== BeagleBone Black

The BeagleBone Black is the newest member in the BeagleBoard family. The board 
is designed to be a low sized small form factor board. The size of the board
is comparable to the size of a credit card and it offers expansion headers to 
add headers called as capes similar to the {uri-raspberry-pi}[Raspberry Pi^].

The table below highlights the key onboard components of the board along with
the connectors available on the board. The diagram of the table below is taken
from the {link-beagleboneblack-srm-pdf}[BeagleBone Black System Reference Manual^].

== Software

=== Ubuntu

To work with an embedded system you need a work station on which you can
perform the various tasks that are required in the development life cycle.
These tasks include:

. Editing your build scripts and source code
. Cross-compiling your source code for the embedded target
. Transferring or accessing the cross-compiled application and libraries
to or from the embedded target 
. Collecting debug information from the target
. Communicating with the target remotely using its interfaces like
serial, USB, network, etc..

In this document we use the popular Debian based Linux operating system,
{uri-ubuntu}[Ubuntu] as our work station for all the tasks listed above.
Ubuntu can be easily downloaded and installed on any PC or laptop. 

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not use a virtual machine runnning Ubuntu as your workstation 
====
This document uses Ubuntu 14.04 running on a HP laptop. Use of a similar
environment through a virtual machine runnning on {uri-vmware}[VMWare^] or
{uri-oracle-virtualbox}[Oracle VirtualBox^] is
not recommended.
