[NOTE]
.This document is under active development!
====
If you find errors or omissions in this document, please don't hesitate to {uri-conrad-mail}[send me a mail].
====

This journal assumes you are comfortable with a linux environment as most of the
published work here uses an Ubuntu distribution as the work station.


= Introduction

[partintro]
--
This journal was started in order to document my exploration of embedded linux
using a popular low-cost platform i.e. the BeagleBone Black. The end objective 
is to become well versed with embedded linux development on an ARM based embedded
device.

== About The Linux Kernel

"I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing
since April and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things
people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical
layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things)."
-- Linus Torvald: 25th August 1991

The Linux kernel started off as a hobby project and by a Finnish
national Linus Torvalds. It is today the OS powering the largest number of
computers on the planet. It is used in phones, tablets, laptops, netbooks,
routers, desktops, servers, supercomputers, embedded devices, consumer
electronics, etc.

The development of the Linux kernel is carried out by an army of dynamic
open source developers, the majority of which comprise of hobbyists. 
Significant contribution to the kernel is now coming from companies using
the kernel. The development is still spearheaded by Linus who is employed
by the {uri-linux-foundation}[Linux Foundation^].


== About BeagleBoard
{uri-beagleboard}[BeagleBoard.org Foundation^] is a non-profit corporation which
promotes open source software and open hardware. It was started by enthusiasts
from TI with the aim of providing a powerful platform to design embedded solutions.
The BeagleBone Black is their fourth board till date which offers a lot of 
possibilities in a small credit card size form factor.

== About Free Electrons
{uri-free-electrons}[Free Electrons^] is an engineering company consisting of
embedded linux experts who support companies using Embedded Linux. They 
additionally conduct training workshops for companies on different topics 
such as Linux kernel and device driver development, Android system development, 
Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded development, etc. This journal uses the Free 
Electrons training material which they publish online to explore Embedded Linux
with the BeagleBone Black board from TI.

= Training and Workbench Setup

[partintro]
--
This section covers the setup software and hardware used in this journal.
The sources of the training material and references are mentioned as well
as details about how to procure the hardware.

== Hardware

=== BeagleBone Black

The BeagleBone Black is the newest member in the BeagleBoard family. The board 
is designed to be a low sized small form factor board. The size of the board
is comparable to the size of a credit card and it offers expansion headers to 
add headers called as capes similar to the {uri-raspberry-pi}[Raspberry Pi^].

== Software

=== Ubuntu

To work with an embedded system you need a work station on which you can
perform the various tasks that are required in the development life cycle.
These tasks include:

. Editing your build scripts and source code
. Cross-compiling your source code for the embedded target
. Transferring or accessing the cross-compiled application and libraries
to or from the embedded target 
. Collecting debug information from the target
. Communicating with the target remotely using its interfaces like
serial, USB, network, etc..

In this document we use the popular Debian based Linux operating system,
{uri-ubuntu}[Ubuntu] as our work station for all the tasks listed above.
Ubuntu can be easily downloaded and installed on any PC or laptop. 

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not use a virtual machine runnning Ubuntu as your workstation 
====
This document uses Ubuntu 14.04 running on a HP laptop. Use of a similar
environment through a virtual machine runnning on {uri-vmware}[VMWare^] or
{uri-oracle-virtualbox}[Oracle VirtualBox^] is
not recommended.
====

=== GIT

The source code management tool used by the Linux kernel community is 
{uri-git-scm}[GIT^]. To use GIT we need to install the packages required
on our work station using the Advanced Packaging Tool(APT) using a 
command line terminal.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ sudo apt-get install git gitk git-email
----

Once the packages are successfully installed we will need to configure GIT with
some basic information about our name and email address

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ git config --global user.name Conrad Gomes
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ git config --global user.email conrad.s.j.gomes@gmail.com
----

Further infomation about GIT can be obtained at: +
{uri-git-scm}[{uri-git-scm}^].

= The Kernel Source Code

[partintro]
--
This section covers details about the Linux Kernel source code. We will go through
the source code, its structure and characteristics.
--

== Offical and Unofficial Kernel Sources

The official source of the Linux Kernel is available at: +
{uri-kernel-org}[{uri-kernel-org}^]

The sources present in this website do not represent the entire spectrum of
features and development that is taking place. Since the kernel is logically
divided into sub-systems, each sub-system is maintained by a designated
individual who has been involved with the sub-system and is trusted by Linus.
So when the merge window opens these individuals who are termed as "maintainers"
send pull requests to Linus to take in the patches from their repositories for
merging with the mainline kernel tree. In some cases if the subsystem is large
it may be divided into smaller subsystems which are managed by individuals
designated as "sub-maintainers".

The official development repository for some sub-systems are given below:

. MTD +
*Website:* {uri-linux-mtd-org}[{uri-linux-mtd-org}^] +
*GIT:* {uri-linux-mtd-git}

. MIPS +
*Website:* {uri-linux-mips-org}[{uri-linux-mips-org}^] +
*GIT:* {uri-linux-mips-git}

. USB +
*Website:* {uri-linux-usb-org}[{uri-linux-usb-org}^] +
*GIT:* {uri-linux-usb-git}

=== Cloning the Linux Tree With GIT

Now that GIT is present in the workstation we can get the main development tree
of the Linux kernel as follows:

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
----

And if you're in a corporarte environment or if your firewall blocks out the 
network port for _git_ you can use _http_ instead as follows:

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ git clone http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
----

The whole process should take a while so you can go for a small coffee break
and come back. Comparitively using _git_ is recommended as it is faster than
_http_

If you happen to have a copy of the Linux GIT repository all you have to do
is pull in the latest changes

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ cd ~/git/linux
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git checkout master
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git pull
----

Once you have the Linux GIT repository you can pull the latest changes by 
by running _git pull_.

=== Using Stable Releases

Typically when we are developing a project we reuse multiple projects to build
our application on top of. Similarly since we will be learing about Embedded
Linux we cannot use the tip of the tree as it is the latest but not the stablest
version of the kernel. 

With GIT we don't have to clone the whole repository all over again. Instead we
can add a reference to a remote tree to our existing clone and fetch all the
commits which are unique in that repository. As the *_stable_* release is
derived from the *_mainline_* tree we can add a remote to our repository as
follows:

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git remote -v # <1>
origin	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git (fetch)
origin	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git (push)
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git remote add stable git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git # <2>
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git remote -v
origin	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git (fetch)
origin	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git (push)
stable	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git (fetch) # <3>
stable	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git (push)
----
<1> _git remote -v_ lists the remotes. By default the git repository from which the repository was cloned will be the main remote
<2> _git remote add_ adds a new remote with the name stable
<3> _git remote -v_ lists the new added remote

The last part is fetching the unique commits in the *_stable_* remote. This
command should take a while.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git fetch stable
----


== Why Are The Sources So Big?

One of the reasons why cloning the kernel sources takes so long is that the
Linux Kernel source code is BIG. This is because the Kernel source code
contains many subsystems, frameworks, drivers, network protocols and supports
many different processor architectures.

=== Size Comparison of Different Kernel Source Directories

If we check the disk usage per directory in the Linux Kernel source code we
get the distribution below. We'll go through the type of source code in each
of those directories in a later section.

[source,bash]
----

== Programming Religion

The Linux Kernel is written primarily in C with a little assembly code too. The
source code is written in a version of C supported by Gnu Compiler Collection
or GCC. Therefore the Linux Kernel source can not be compiled with all C
compilers.

The assembly code comprises of small sections of code and is basically the 
GCC's "AT&T-style" syntax of target architecture which will run the kernel.

Even though the Linux Kernel has certain frameworks designed with Object 
Oriented Principles in mind it is not written in C++. For further
understanding on why C++ is still not used please see the following link:
{uri-lkml-programming-religion}[{uri-lkml-programming-religion}^]

And on a lighter note ...

[quote, Linus Torvalds, 19 Jan 2004]
____
In fact, in Linux we did try C++ once already, back in 1992.

It sucks. Trust me - writing kernel code in C++ is a BLOODY STUPID IDEA.

The fact is, C++ compilers are not trustworthy. They were even worse in 
1992, but some fundamental facts haven't changed:

 - the whole C++ exception handling thing is fundamentally broken. It's 
   _especially_ broken for kernels.
 - any compiler or language that likes to hide things like memory
   allocations behind your back just isn't a good choice for a kernel.
 - you can write object-oriented code (useful for filesystems etc) in C, 
   _without_ the crap that is C++.

In general, I'd say that anybody who designs his kernel modules for C++ is 
either 
 (a) looking for problems
 (b) a C++ bigot that can't see what he is writing is really just C anyway
 (c) was given an assignment in CS class to do so.

Feel free to make up (d).
____

== No C Library

The Linux Kernel is a single program which has its own routines to perform
common functions. It does not use any user space library like stdlib, rather
it has equivalent functions that enable it to achieve the same results.

In place of the standard C functions like printf(), memset(), malloc() there
are functions like printk(), memset(),kmalloc() in the source code.

== Portability

One of the Linux Kernel key features is portability and hardware support.
It supports a wide variety of architectures and to achieve this the source
code should be portable across architectures. The architecture specific code is
all located in the _arch/_ directory. The remaining code in all the other
directories has to be portable across all architectures.

To achieve portability there are hardware abstraction API for specific
features:

. Endianess
- cpu_to_be32()
- cpu_to_le32()
- be32_to_cpu()
- le32_to_cpu()
. I/O Memory Access
. Memory barriers 
. DMA API to flush and invalidate caches

Since the Linux Kernel is designed to run on any processor the use of floating
point expressions is not allowed. As an example consider the most popular embedded
architecture i.e. ARM, it does not have a floating point unit. 

== Linux Internal API

One of the main reasons for having drivers in-tree i.e. present along with the
sources of the Linux Kernel is that the internal Linux API may be changed at 
any point in time and if a change is proposed and implemented the developer
responsible for the API change will also have to take the ownership of changing
all the modules and drivers which use the changed API. In the case of an
out-of-tree driver the work will be owned by the driver owner and any time a
change occurs the driver will not compile with the latest kernel source code.

Having said that the Linux Kernel external API i.e. kernel to userspace API like
system calls, /proc, /sys does not change and is considered to protect the user
space applications who depend on it.

== Is It Free?

The Linux Kernel is licensed under GNU General Public License version 2. This
license defines the Linux Kernel as Free Software as defined by the
{uri-free-software-foundation}[Free Software Foundation^].

. If you redistribute the software you have to do so under the same license
irrespective of whether it is modified or unmodified.

. If you make modifications to the Linux Kernel you have to release it under
the same license.

. You only have to do so when your device with the kernel start getting
distributed

. You only have to license it to your customers and not necessarily the whole
world.

. It is illegal to distribute a binary kernel with statically compiled
proprietary drivers.

. Proprietary drivers are frowned upon by the Linux Kernel community as it goes
against the philosophy of the GPL license.

== Advantages Of GPL Drivers

. It is possible to reuse software from other GPL drivers to write a new GPL
driver

. A GPL driver has more contributors, testers, reviewers and maintainers
thereby making it more robust.

. Once the driver is accepted it is easily shipped and distributed by
others who are using the Linux Kernel.

. A pre-compiled driver will always have to catch up with the latest kernel
devlopments leaving users of the driver at a loss as they can't upgrade
their kernel with ease in order to use the latest source with new features

. Making a driver GPL compliant avoids any potential legal hastles

== Advantages Of In-Tree Kernel Drivers

. Acceptance of a driver into the mainline kernel is a step that must be
done by developers who have developed a GPL compatible driver.

. This allows the developer to release the ownership of maintaining the
kernel driver to the community. This reduces the cost of maintainence.

. The source of the kernel driver is easily accessible by anyone, as the
kernel code is widely published.

== User Space Device Drivers

It is possible to develop a user space device driver. There are several 
scenarios in which a user space device driver is developed:

. The device driver does not depend on any of the frameworks exposed by
the Linux Kernel.

. The device driver is used by only one application and is not required
by any other application.

. The kernel provides a simple interface with which the user space device
driver can control and read the hardware for which it is developed.

=== Examples Of User Space Device Drivers

Certain busses have interfaces exposed by the kernel which can be used to
develop a user space device driver if the hardware is connected to that 
bus:

. USB with libusb, {uri-libusb-org}[{uri-libusb-org}^]
. SPI wiht spidev, {uri-kernel-org-spidev-doc}[Documentation/spi/spidev^] 
. I2C with i2cdev, {uri-kernel-org-i2cdev-doc}[Documentation/i2c/dev-interface^]
. Memory-mapped devices with UIO, including interrupt handling, {uri-free-electrons-uio-howto}[{uri-free-electrons-uio-howto}^]

On certain SOCs the vendor also provides a user space device driver along with
a kernel driver which has access to other processors in the SOC which are
running a firmware for highly specialized applications.

=== The Good And The Bad Of User Space Device Drivers

The Good

. The driver can be written in any programming language or script.
. The driver can be kept proprietary.
. The driver runs in user space as an application or daemon.
. The driver cannot bring down the kernel.

The Bad

. Handling interrupts from the hardware is non-trivial resulting in some sort
of polling mechanism.
. The interrupt latency is larger when compared to a kernel device driver.

== What's In The Sources?

We'll briefly go through each of the sources in the Linux Source Code and try
to get an understanding of the overall structure of the source tree. Each
directory is a placeholder for certain code, scripts and files which serve
to make up the Linux Kernel project.

arch/<ARCH>:: Architecture specific code. All code that has anything to do with the
processor the kernel is running on is present in this directory
*  arch/<ARCH>/mach-<machine>, machine/board specific code
*  arch/<ARCH>/include/asm, architecture-specific headers
*  arch/<ARCH>boot/dts, Device Tree source files for certain architecture

== Browsing The Sources

One of the most common tasks required by any developer is the ability to browse
a project and search for:

. A specific symbol such as a function name or variable name
. The calling function of a function
. The function definition using a function call point
. An include file in the project from its declaration in source code
. A pattern of text

=== Cscope

One such tool is Cscope which allows us to browse the Linux source code with ease
from editors like vim, emacs and also independently using only cscope.

=== LXR

This is a generic indexing tool and code browser which is available as a web
service. It supports both C and C++ and it makes it easy to search for 
declarations, definitions  and symbols. A good examples of LXR with the Linux
Kernel in action is through the {uri-lxr-free-electrions}[Free Electrons LXR Site^]
and further information abouit LXR can be obtained from its
{uri-sourceforge-lxr}[sourceforge page^].

== Getting Accustomed To Browsing The Sources

[NOTE]
.This is a hands on session taken from the Free Electrons labs with the following objectives
====
. Create a branch based on a remote tree to explore a particular stable kernel
version (from the stable kernel tree).
. Explore the sources in search for files, function headers or other kinds of
information. . .
. Browse the kernel sources with tools like cscope and LXR.
====

=== Creating A Branch To A Particular Stable Kernel Version

In order to get the list of branches on our stable remote tree we have to
enter the Linux Kernel source tree and use the _git branch_ command as
follows:

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ cd ~/git/linux
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git branch -a
* master	#<1>
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/stable/linux-2.6.11.y		#<2>
  remotes/stable/linux-2.6.12.y
.
.
  remotes/stable/linux-3.9.y
  remotes/stable/master
----
<1> Our source code is currently pointing to the master branch
<2> Remote stable branch remotes/stable/linux-2.6.11.y

We will be working with the 3.13 stable branch and so we will use the remote
branch *_remotes/stable/linux-3.13.y_* from the list of branches displayed.

Before we do anything let us check the version of our *_master_* branch using
the top level Makefile in the source code. Using _vim_ or your favourite editor
or head examine the first few lines of the Makefile

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ head Makefile 
VERSION = 3
PATCHLEVEL = 18
SUBLEVEL = 0
EXTRAVERSION = -rc4
NAME = Diseased Newt
.
.
----

We can see the version of our _master_ branch is at 3.18.0 -rc4 and the name
of the release is "Diseased Newt". Now let us create a local branch starting
from the stable remote branch of 3.13.y. The following command uses 
_git checkout_ to checkout the stable remote branch _stable/linux-3.13.y_ as
a local branch with the name _3.13.y_.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git checkout -b 3.13.y stable/linux-3.13.y	# <1>
Checking out files: 100% (27044/27044), done.
Branch 3.13.y set up to track remote branch linux-3.13.y from stable.
Switched to a new branch '3.13.y'	# <2>
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ 
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ git branch -a	# <3>
* 3.13.y	# <4>
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
.
.
----
<1> Command to checkout the stable remote branch as a local branch
<2> The switch to the new branch takes place successfully
<3> We list all the branches again
<4> The git repository now points to the _3.13.y_ local branch

Once again let us examine the first few lines of the top level Makefile. We can
now see the version is at 3.13.11 and the name of the release is
"One Giant Leap for Frogkind". So we have successfully managed to create a 
branch pointing to a stable release of the Linux Kernel source code.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/git/linux$ head Makefile 
VERSION = 3
PATCHLEVEL = 13
SUBLEVEL = 11
EXTRAVERSION =
NAME = One Giant Leap for Frogkind
.
.
----
