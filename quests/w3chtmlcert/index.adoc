= Introduction

== What is HTML?

* *HTML* stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**ark **U**p language.
* Markup language is a way of presenting a document with meta information
which is separate from the information of the document.
* The meta information is represented as TAGs in the HTML document
 
== Creating a simple HTML page

A simple HTML page can be created using a text editor like Vim or Emacs on
Linux. Similarly Notepad can be used to create a simple HTML document. To 
manage the complexity of larger projects and websites professional editors
such as Adobe Dreamweaver, Kompozer, etc  

On opening your favourite editor type out the following to create a simple
HTML page:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>A Simple HTML Page</h1>

<p>Gee whizz this is easy!</p>

</body>
</html>
----

Once the above is typed in save the file with a suitable name and remember
the location of the file saved. If you are using Firefox you should go to
"File" in the menu bar and select the "Open File" option. Browse your file
system for the file you have just saved and open it. The following shows 
the simple HTML page rendered by Firefox and Chrome respectively.

====
[[img-simple-html-page-chrome-print-screen]]
.Simple HTML Page on Chrome
image::simple-html-page-chrome-print-screen.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link=images/simple-html-page-chrome-print-screen.png]

====

.Simple HTML Page on Firefox

== Doctype

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration specifies the type of HTML document. The doctype
declaration is NOT a tag. There are different versions of HTML. The browser
will understand the format of the document from its doctype declaration.
