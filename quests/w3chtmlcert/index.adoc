= Introduction

== What is HTML?

* *HTML* stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**ark **U**p language.
* Markup language is a way of presenting a document with meta information
which is separate from the information of the document.
* The meta information is represented as TAGs in the HTML document
 
== Creating a simple HTML page

A simple HTML page can be created using a text editor like Vim or Emacs on
Linux. Similarly Notepad can be used to create a simple HTML document. To 
manage the complexity of larger projects and websites professional editors
such as Adobe Dreamweaver, Kompozer, etc  

On opening your favourite editor type out the following to create a simple
HTML page:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>A Simple HTML Page</h1>

<p>Gee whizz this is easy!</p>

</body>
</html>
----

Once the above is typed in save the file with a suitable name and remember
the location of the file saved. If you are using Firefox you should go to
"File" in the menu bar and select the "Open File" option. Browse your file
system for the file you have just saved and open it. The following shows 
the simple HTML page rendered by Firefox and Chrome respectively.

====
[[img-simple-html-page-chrome-print-screen]]
.Simple HTML Page on Chrome

.Simple HTML Page on Firefox

== Doctype

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration specifies the type of HTML document. The doctype
declaration is NOT a tag. There are different versions of HTML. The browser
will understand the format of the document from its doctype declaration.

=== HTML 5

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
----

=== HTML 4.01 Strict

* Does *NOT* allows the use of framset content.
* Does *NOT* include presentational elements.
* Does *NOT* include deprecated elements like font.

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
----

=== HTML 4.01 Transitional

* Does *NOT* allow the use of framset content.
* Includes presentational elements.
* Includes deprecated elements like font.

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
----

=== HTML 4.01 Frameset

Allows the use of framset content.

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">
----

=== XHTML 1.0 Strict

* Similar to HTML 4.01 Strict
* Must be written as well-formed XML

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
----

=== XHTML 1.0 Transitional

* Similar to HTML 4.01 Transitional
* Must be written as well-formed XML

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
----

=== XHTML 1.0 Frameset

* Similar to HTML 4.01 Frameset
* Must be written as well-formed XML

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd">
----

=== XHTML 1.1

* Equal to XHTML 1.0 Strict.
* Allows the addition of modules (for example to provide ruby support for East-Asian languages).

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

== Elements

An HTML document consists of HTML elements. An element consists of content
wrapped in a set of tags. The name of the tag defines the type of content
and each element has a start tag and an end tag:

[source,html]
----
<tagname>content</tagname>
----

=== Example of HTML Elements

[source,html]
----
<p>Gee whizz this is easy!</p>
----

In the above example *_<p>_* is the element which defines the start of a 
paragraph and *_<p>_* defines the end of a paragraph. The content in between
i.e. *_"Gee whizz this is easy!"_* defines the content that forms the paragraph.

[NOTE]
====
Not all HTML elements have a starting and ending tag.
====

=== Example of Nested HTML elements

HTML elements can be nested. Taking the same Simple HTML page example we can
clearly see that there are certain HTML elements which are defined within others

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> # <1>
<body> # <3>

<h1>A Simple HTML Page</h1> # <5>

<p>Gee whizz this is easy!</p> # <6>

</body> # <4>
</html> # <2>
----
<1> Element starting the html document i.e. the html element
<2> Element ending the html document
<3> Starting the content of the html document i.e the body element
<4> Ending the content of the html document
<5> Heading element with start and end tags
<6> Paragraph element with start and end tags

So in the above example we can see the *_body_* element nested within the
*_html_* element

=== Empty HTML Elements

Elements with no content are called empty elements. For example a line break
element is an empty element. Empty elements need not be closed but can be
closed in the beginning like this:

[source,html]
----
</br>
----

=== Recommendations

. It is better to have all tags in lower case even though it is not compulsory.
Browsers should be able to handle tags irrespective of their case. W3C says tags
*MUST* be in lower case for HTML documents.

. Some elements may be handled correctly in the browser if the end tag is
forgotten, however it is better to insert the end tag for elements which have
an end tag.
