== Advantages Of In-Tree Kernel Drivers

. Acceptance of a driver into the mainline kernel is a step that must be
done by developers who have developed a GPL compatible driver.

. This allows the developer to release the ownership of maintaining the
kernel driver to the community. This reduces the cost of maintainence.

. The source of the kernel driver is easily accessible by anyone, as the
kernel code is widely published.
