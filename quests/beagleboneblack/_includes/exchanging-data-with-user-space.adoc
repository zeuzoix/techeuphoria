== Exchanging Data With User Space

Since user space memory is different from kernel space memory we can't use
a simple _memcpy_ to copy data from user space to kernel space. Additionally
dereferencing a user space pointer in kernel space will not work on all platforms.
Moreover if the pointer being dereferenced is invalid it will lead to a segfault
in the application.

Linux defines a set of functions to keep the kernel code portable when it comes
to copying data from user space to kernel space and vice versa. The first two
functions copy single values and the last two copy buffers:

get_user(v, p);::
The kernel variable _v_ gets the value pointed by the user space pointer _p_

put_user(v, p);::
The value of the variable refered by the pointer _p_ is set to the value
of the kernel variable _v_

unsigned long copy_to_user(void __user *to, const void *from, unsigned long n);::
Copy the contents of the kernel buffer _from_ to the user space buffer _to_ upto
_n_ bytes. Return 0 on success and -EFAULT on failure.

unsigned long copy_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from, unsigned long n);::
Copy the contents of the user space buffer _from_ to the kernel buffer _to_ upto
_n_ bytes. Return 0 on success and -EFAULT on failure.

=== Zero Copy Access To User Space

We looked at the functions that allow us to copy data between user space and kernel
space. If the amount of data we're dealing with is huge we need a more efficient
mechanism. We'd like to keep our system as efficient as possible and free up
our processor to do other activities besides copying.

The Linux kernel offers _zero copy_ options:

mmap::
This system call allows user space to directly access memory mapped I/O space.

get_user_pages_fast::
This allows a kernel module to get access to user pages without copying them.
The API is more complex to use though.
