== Developing Kernel Modules

We will first take a look at a sample source code of a Linux kernel module.

[source, C]
----
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
<1>

static int __init sample_module_init(void)	<2>
{
	pr_alert("Wassup!\n");
	return 0;
}

static void __exit sample_module_exit(void)	<4>
{
	pr_alert("Cya Later!\n");
}
	
module_init(sample_module_init);		<3>
module_exit(sample_module_exit);		<5>
	
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");				
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Sample Module");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Newbie");
<6>
----
<1> Only headers specific to the Linux kernel, no access to the standard C
library
<2> Defining an initialization function, returns an int to indicate the
status of the initialization when _insmod_ is used to load the module.
<3> The macro _module_init_ is used to register the initialization
function for the module.
<4> Defining a  cleanup function for the module.
<5> The macro _module_exit_ is used to register the cleanup function for
the module.
<6> Metadata for the module defining the license type, description and
the author.


The source code is in C but it has some special symbols which are not
used in user space application programming: +

__init:: This indicates that the module initializaiton function
_sample_module_init_ can be removed after initialization. The function is called
only once when the module starts up and thereafter is not used. This optimizes
the memory usage of the kernel.

__exit:: This indicates that the function is discarded if the module is
compiled statically into the kernel or if module unloading is disabled. Its
primary use is for loadable kernel modules.

It should be noted that the name of the initialization and cleanup
functions can be anything however the module name is often used to form
the functions (<modulename>_init()/<modulename_exit()).

=== Symbols Exported To Modules

A kernel module can use functions and variables defined in other parts of the Linux
kernel source code so long as they are exported. There are two macros
that are used to export the symbol names that can be used by other modules: +

EXPORT_SYMBOL(symbolname):: Exports a function or variable to all modules
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(symbolname):: Exports a function or variable to only GPL
modules

The diagram illustrates the difference between exporting a symbol with
_EXPORT_SYMBOL_ versus _EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_. Symbols exported by
_EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_(func3, func4) can be used by only GPL modules whereas
symbols exported by _EXPORT_SYMBOL_ can be used by both GPL and Non-GPL
modules. A module gets it's license from the _MODULE_LICENSE_ macro added
in it's source code along with the other metadata.

----
<1> Module license is GPL

The kernel can only use symbols defined in its source code. It cannot
use symbols exported by _modules_ even if they are GPL licensed modules.
Symbols exported with _EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_ can be used only by GPL licensed
modules. Symbols exported with _EXPORT_SYMBOL_ can be used by GPL and Non-GPL
licensed modules

=== About Module Licenses

The _MODULE_LICENSE_ macro is used to define the license of the module. It is
used to restrict the functions that a module can use if it is not a GPL licensed
module. GPL licensed modules have access to all exported symbols whereas
Non-GPL licensed modules can only access symbols exported with _EXPORT_SYMBOL_.

Another use for module licenses is to identify issues comming from proprietary
modules. Typically kernel developers do not fix issues coming from proprietary
modules or drivers which cause kernel crashes and OOPSes.

[source, C]
----
#ifndef __LICENSE_H
#define __LICENSE_H

static inline int license_is_gpl_compatible(const char *license)
{
        return (strcmp(license, "GPL") == 0
                || strcmp(license, "GPL v2") == 0
                || strcmp(license, "GPL and additional rights") == 0
                || strcmp(license, "Dual BSD/GPL") == 0
                || strcmp(license, "Dual MIT/GPL") == 0
                || strcmp(license, "Dual MPL/GPL") == 0);
}

#endif
----

GPL compatible licenses are defined in the _include/linux/license.h_ file as
shown above. These include GPL, GPL v2, GPL and additional rights, Dual BSD/GPL,
Dual MIT/GPL or Dual MPL/GPL. All other licenses are considered as proprietary.

=== Compiling Modules Out Of Tree

The source code is maintained separately outside the kernel source code.
It is easier to modify the source code, however adapting the module source
code to changes in the kernel API means that the maintainer has the onus
of keeping it upto date with the changing kernel. One disadvantage is that
the module cannot be built statically with the kernel. The following snippet
shows the Makefile that can be used to build an out of tree kernel
module/driver.

[source, makefile]
----
ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
obj-m := wassup.o
else
KDIR := /path/to/kernel/sources

all:
	$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$$PWD	<1>
endif
----
<1> Rule for the target _all_

When compiled out of tree the Makefile does not have _KERNELRELEASE_ defined
and therefore KDIR is set to the path to either: 

. Full kernel directory
. Kernel Headers Directory

The kernel Makefile gets invoked as _KDIR_ is set and the rule for the target
_all_ will change to the _KDIR_ first and call the corresponding Makefile in that
path. Additionally _$PWD_ is passed as an argument value in _M_ to the kernel
Makefile. The double $$ is required to pass $PWD as the value to _M_.

The kernel Makefile knows that it has to compile a module and because there
is a value for _M_ it can locate where the module Makefile is present. This
time the kernel Makefile calls the module Makefile and the value of
_KERNELRELEASE_ is defined. The kernel uses the definition of _obj-m_ to
identify the module to be compiled which in our case is _wassup.o_. In this
way the module Makefile given above is invoked twice, the first time  from the
module directory and second time by the kernel Makefile.

The kernel directory pointed to by _KDIR_ in the module makefile must be
configured as there will be differences between different configurations of
the kernel. The module compiled against a specific version will only load in
that version and configuration of the kernel. If there is a mismatch then
_insmod/modprobe_ will crib with an output _"Invalid module format"_.

=== Compiling Modules Inside Of The  Kernel Tree

The source code is integrated inside the kernel source code. It can be
integrated with the configuration and compilation process of the kernel.
The module can be built statically with the kernel source code.

To add a new driver or module to the kernel source tree we have to place
the source file in the appropriate source directory. For example we'll
take a look at the _USB serial navman_ driver. The source code for the
driver/module should be present in a single file. If the driver is
really big then it should have its own directory. The source file 
for the _navman_ driver is in _drivers/usb/serial/navman.c_

To configure the kernel to include a module or driver we need to add
information in the _drivers/usb/serial/Kconfig_ file in the same directory.
The snippet below shows that the navman driver has a kernel option type of
_tristate_ which means it can be enabled, disabled or configured as a module.

[source, bash]
----
.
.
config USB_SERIAL_NAVMAN
        tristate "USB Navman GPS device"
        help
          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
          module will be called navman.
.
.
----

Next we take a look at the _drivers/usb/serial/Makefile_ which has
a line based on the _drivers/usb/serial/Kconfig_ setting. The name
of the configuration field _CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_NAVMAN_ is derived
from the KConfig settings. The value of _CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_NAVMAN_
will be based on the configuration applied upon invoking
_make menuconfig_. After configuring the kernel and enabling th
module/driver we can build it by running _make_.

[source, makefile]
----
.
.
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_MOS7840)                += mos7840.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_NAVMAN)                 += navman.o
obj-$(CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_OMNINET)                += omninet.o
.
