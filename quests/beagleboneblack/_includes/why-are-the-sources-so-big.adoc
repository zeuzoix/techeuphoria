== Why Are The Sources So Big?

One of the reasons why cloning the kernel sources takes so long is that the
Linux Kernel source code is BIG. This is because the Kernel source code
contains many subsystems, frameworks, drivers, network protocols and supports
many different processor architectures.

=== Size Comparison of Different Kernel Source Directories

If we check the disk usage per directory in the Linux Kernel source code we
get the distribution below. We'll go through the type of source code in each
of those directories in a later section.
