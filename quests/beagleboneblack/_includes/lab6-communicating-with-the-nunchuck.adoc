== LAB 6 : Communicating With The Nunchuck
 
[NOTE]
.This is a hands on session taken from the Free Electrons labs with the following objectives
====
. Hooking up the nunchuck to the board.
. Configuring the pinmuxing for the I2C bus used.
. Validate I2C communication works with user space tools.
. Extend the I2C driver from the previous lab to communicate with the Nunchuck.
====

=== Connecting The Nunchuck

We will now hook up the nunchuck to the Beagle Bone Black board. The diagram below
gives the names of the different pins on the connector.

====

====

Now we open up the {link-beagleboneblack-srm-pdf}[BBB system reference manual^] and
search for "connector P9". Under this section we see the "Expansion Header P9 Pinout"
table which describes the signals for the different peripherals on the SOC. So we
need to make sure our connections from the Nunchuck are:
. The GND pin to P9 pins 1 or 2 (GND)
. The PWR pin to P9 pins 3 or 4 (DC_3.3V)
. The CLK pin to P9 pin 17 (I2C1_SCL)
. The DATA pin to P9 pin 18 (I2C1_SDA)

On hooking up the breakout board we need to understand which pins correspond to
which signals. The + & - signs correspond to VCC(3.3V) and GND. The P & C
correspond to SDA and SCL of I2C. We make the connections on the P9 connector
using a breadboard and some wiring. Our hooked up connection is shown below.

=== Configuring Pin Muxing Configuration For I2C1

Configuring the pin mux settings for our I2C1 bus on the SOC
is going to involve going through several documents. If we go through the
"Expansion Header P9 Pinout" table in the  
{link-beagleboneblack-srm-pdf}[BBB system reference manual^] we can also
see the pins of the AM335 SOC
associated with the signals _I2C1_SCL_ and _I2C1_SDA_ which happen to be
A16 and B16 respectively. We also see the different "MODES" that these
pins can be muxed as and for I2C1 we need them to be in _MODE2_.

Our next step is to inspect the CPU {link-am3359-datasheet-pdf}[datasheet^].
We go through the Pin Assignment section. You will find that the processor is
available through two types of packages: ZCE and ZCZ. Our CPU has ZCZ written
on its lower right corner. In the ZCZ pin assignment section we can see
hyperlinks associated with each pin of the SOC. If we click on the A16 pin which
is named as _SPI_CS0_ we see that to set it as _I2C1_SCL_ we need to use _MODE2_.
The pin is named as _SPI_CS0_ because that is the function of the pin in MODE0.
We also see that B16 is named _SPI0_D1_ because of its association in _MODE0_
and to get it to _I2C1_SDA_ we need to set it to _MODE2_. The default names
of the pins will be useful going forward.

Finally we need to change the pin mux settings somehow. We open the
{link-am3358-technical-reference-manual-pdf}[AM3358 technical reference document^]
and look for registers that can help us do this. Specifically look for the
"Control Module" section.

The control module includes status and control logic not addressed within the
peripherals or the rest of the device infrastructure. This module provides
interface to control the following areas of the device:
. Functional I/O multiplexing
. Emulation controls
. Device control and status
. DDR PHY control and IO control registers
. EDMA event multiplexing control registers

We search for the "Control Module Registers" and find its address in the _L4 WKUP Peripheral Memory Map_
table with start address 0x44E1_0000 and end address 0x44E1_1FFF. If we click on the Control Module
hyperlink in the _L4 WKUP Peripheral Memory Map_ table we can see the offsets of the registers
controlling the _SPI0_CS0_ and _SPI0_D1_ pins as _conf_spi0_d1_ (0x958) and _conf_spi0_cs0_ (0x95C).
Clicking on the hyperlinks associated with the offsets takes us to the register descriptions.

=== Add _pinctrl_ Properties To The Device Tree

Armed with the knowledge of register settings we shall try to add the pinctrl configuration
for the I2C1 bus on the SOC. We can refer to another platforms file to get a sense
of how to use the register. For this we take a look at the _arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-evm.dts_
file.

<1> Configuring the _conf_spi0_d1_ 
<2> Configuring the _conf_spi0_cs0_


We have 0x158 instead of 0x958 and 0x15C instead of 0x95C. The difference
is because of the offset present in the way the base address for the control module register
is defined in the base _dtsi_ file. Let's take a look:

[source, c]
----
.
.
        am33xx_pinmux: pinmux@44e10800 {
                compatible = "pinctrl-single";
                reg = <0x44e10800 0x0238>; <1>
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;
                pinctrl-single,register-width = <32>;
                pinctrl-single,function-mask = <0x7f>;
        };
.
.
----
<1> The base address is set as 0x44e10800 instead of 0x44e10000

The base address is set to 0x44e10800 because the registers below 
the 0x800 offset are not related to the pinctrl functionality.
Therefore, starting at offset 0x800 is probably a way to make
sure that using the pinctrl-single driver, users can only access
real pin muxing registers and do not mess with lower registers by mistake.

The values of the configuration registers are set to:
. _MUX_MODE2_ corresponding to muxing mode 2, as explained in the datasheet
. _PIN_INPUT_PULLUP_ puts the pin in the pull up mode. This is for I2C bus signalling.

We make modifications to _arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-boneblack.dts_ and add
the pinctrl configuration for I2C1. Additionally we need to define the pinctrl
settings in our i2c1 node from the previous lab.

=== I2C Bus Tests

To see if everything works fine we use the _i2cdetect -r 1_ command.

[WARNING] 
.Using _i2cdetect -r 1_
==== 
According to the {uri-i2cdetect-manpage}[man page^], this command uses the
SMBus "read byte" commands for probing. It uses a command which will be
safest for each address. Since we're following the Free Electrons lab
we use it but otherwise it's better to read up before using it for an
unknown I2C device.

=== Nunchuck Device Initialization

We will need to read the registers of the Nunchuck to find out whether the buttons
are pressed or not. But before that we will need to initiate the Nunchuck.
To communicate with the Nunchuck, we must send a handshake signal. If you are
using a black Wii Nunchuck, send 2 bytes 0xF0, 0x55 to initalize the first register
and 0xFB, 0x00 to initialize the second register of the Nunchuck. On a white send
0x40, 0x00 followed by 0x00. We get this information from the
{link-nunchuck-device}[nunchuck pdf^].

To initialize the device we will modify our probe routine in our platform driver
and use the I2C raw API. The modifications to our driver code are shown below.
We take extra care to check the return value of _i2c_master_send_ to check
for communication issues.

=== Read Nunchuck Registers

The nunchuk has 6 registers with which it relays information as given in {link-nunchuck-device}[the pdf^].

Byte 0x00:: X-axis data of the joystick
Byte 0x01:: Y-axis data of the joystick
Byte 0x02:: X-axis data of the accellerometer sensor
Byte 0x03:: Y-axis data of the accellerometer sensor
Byte 0x04:: Z-axis data of the accellerometer sensor
Byte 0x05:: *bit 0* as Z button status - 0 = pressed and 1 = release;
*bit 1* as C button status - 0 = pressed and 1 = release;
*bit 2 and 3* as 2 lower bit of X-axis data of the accellerometer sensor;
*bit 4 and 5* as 2 lower bit of Y-axis data of the accellerometer sensor;
*bit 6 and 7* as 2 lower bit of Z-axis data of the accellerometer sensor;

The nunchuck updates the registers only once they have been read so we
have to read the registers twice. We create a function _nunchuck_read_registers_
to simplify the impelementation.
