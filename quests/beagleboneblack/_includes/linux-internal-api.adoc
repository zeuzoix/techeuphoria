== Linux Internal API

One of the main reasons for having drivers in-tree i.e. present along with the
sources of the Linux Kernel is that the internal Linux API may be changed at 
any point in time and if a change is proposed and implemented the developer
responsible for the API change will also have to take the ownership of changing
all the modules and drivers which use the changed API. In the case of an
out-of-tree driver the work will be owned by the driver owner and any time a
change occurs the driver will not compile with the latest kernel source code.

Having said that the Linux Kernel external API i.e. kernel to userspace API like
system calls, /proc, /sys does not change and is considered to protect the user
space applications who depend on it.
