== Portability

One of the Linux Kernel key features is portability and hardware support.
It supports a wide variety of architectures and to achieve this the source
code should be portable across architectures. The architecture specific code is
all located in the _arch/_ directory. The remaining code in all the other
directories has to be portable across all architectures.

To achieve portability there are hardware abstraction API for specific
features:

. Endianess
- cpu_to_be32()
- cpu_to_le32()
- be32_to_cpu()
- le32_to_cpu()
. I/O Memory Access
. Memory barriers 
. DMA API to flush and invalidate caches

Since the Linux Kernel is designed to run on any processor the use of floating
point expressions is not allowed. As an example consider the most popular embedded
architecture i.e. ARM, it does not have a floating point unit.
