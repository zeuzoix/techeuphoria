== Device Model Data Structures

The main data structures in the device driver model are:

. The _struct bus_type_ structure represents a bus system viz. USB, SPI, I2C, etc..
. The _struct device_driver_ structure represents one driver capable of handling devices on a certain bus.
. The _struct device_ represents a device connected to a bus.

Inheritance is used in the device driver model in order to create
specialized versions of _struct device driver_ and _struct device_ for specific
bus systems.
