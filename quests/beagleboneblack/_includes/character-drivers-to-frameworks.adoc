== Character Drivers To Kernel Frameworks

We've seen character drivers but most likely if we're developing a driver
it will not be a pure character driver. In most cases we would identify the
class to which the device belongs and find a framework for that class.
Some of the frameworks are framebuffer, V4L, serial, etc. The framework allows
to factorize the common parts of drivers for the same type of devices. From user
space, they are still seen as character devices by the applications. The framework
allows to provide a coherent user space interface (ioctl, etc.) for every type of
device, regardless of the driver.
