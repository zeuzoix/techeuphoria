== The Purpose Behind Having A Device Model

The Linux kernel runs on a wide variety of architectures and platforms.
There are platforms which may have the same type of device for which
the same driver may be used. To fascilitate this architecture a device
model is required so that the driver for a device can be independent
of the platform on which it is implemented.

There are several layers of abstraction in which the Linux kernel
separates the device description from the _device drivers_. Additionally
the _bus drivers_ are separated from the _device drivers_.


== Interfaces To A Kernel Driver

. In Linux the driver is designed to first interface between a *framework*
which groups the functionality of the device to the application in a
generic way. e.g. input devices like keyboards and the mouse are represented
as an input event framework.

. Secondly the driver has to interface with a *bus infrastructure* in order
to access the device. The bus interface can be anything ranging from UART, USB
to SPI.
