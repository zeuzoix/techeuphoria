== Configuring The Kernel

The kernel source code contains code to support many filesystems, device
drivers, network protocols, architectures, etc. The source code can be 
configured to chose which features are required based on the type of
applications that will be run in user space.

Additionally the kernel configuration will also support test code that
may be run to validate device drivers in the system. For example the
MTD system has several kernel modules which can be loaded to validate
the implementation of the mtd device driver code for the flash storage
in the system.

To support this type of configuration there are a series of Makefiles
present in the kernel source code. However to start the configuraton 
and build we would only be required to work with the top level
_Makefile_.

There are various targets defined in the top level Makefile which can
control the configuration, build and installation of the Linux kernel.

To get a sense of the number of targets available we can run _make help_
to see all the targets.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make help | head
Cleaning targets:
  clean		  - Remove most generated files but keep the config and
                    enough build support to build external modules
  mrproper	  - Remove all generated files + config + various backup files
  distclean	  - mrproper + remove editor backup and patch files

Configuration targets:
  config	  - Update current config utilising a line-oriented program
  nconfig         - Update current config utilising a ncurses menu based program
  menuconfig	  - Update current config utilising a menu based program

=== Kernel Configuration

The process of configuring the Linux Kernel includes modifying the
configuration file located at the root of the source code. This file
is named _.config_. The dot at the beginning of the file name indicates
that it is a hidden file.

The syntax of this file is in the form of simple key value pairs as shown
in the example below:

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ head .config	<1>
#
# Automatically generated file; DO NOT EDIT.
# Linux/x86 3.12.0-rc7 Kernel Configuration
#
# CONFIG_64BIT is not set		<2>
CONFIG_X86_32=y
CONFIG_X86=y
CONFIG_INSTRUCTION_DECODER=y
CONFIG_OUTPUT_FORMAT="elf32-i386"
CONFIG_ARCH_DEFCONFIG="arch/x86/configs/i386_defconfig"
.
.
.
---- 
<1> Command to display the first lines of the _.config_ file
<2> _#_ is used to comment out key values in the configuration file

An important point to note is that because options have dependencies it is
not advisable to edit the _.config_ file by hand. Preferably use the available
configuration interfaces.

Graphical Interfaces:: _make xconfig_ OR _make gconfig_
Text/Shell Interfaces:: _make menuconfig_ OR _make nconfig_

It doesn't make any difference which is used and we can shift between either
of the interfaces as they all edit the same _.config_ file.

==== Kernel Configuration In The System

The configuration of a GNU/Linux distribution is usually present along with the
kernel image in the _/boot/_ directory.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ uname -r		<1>
3.13.0-45-generic							<2>
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ ls -l /boot/config-3.13.0-45-generic 	<3>
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 169818 Jan 14 01:53 /boot/config-3.13.0-45-generic			<4>
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ 
----
<1> _uname -r_ is the command to get the kernel running on the system
<2> The kernel running is _3.13.0-45-generic_
<3> Listing the configuration file of this kernel in _/boot/_
<4> The configuration file is _config-3.13.0-45-generic_

=== Configuring Features As Modules

Upon configuring the kernel source and completion of the build we get
a single image which represents the kernel and all the features it is 
configured for. However it is possible to configure some of the features
such as device drivers, filesystems, driver tests, etc. as separate
entities called *kernel modules*.

By configuring certain features as modules we are able to keep the size
of the kernel to a minimum. Kernel modules can be loaded from user space
to support certain applications on execution or on insertion of certain
devices into the system buses like USB, PCI, etc..

Therefore in the configuration of certain features it is possible to select
if the feature needs to be compiled as a kernel module. All kernel modules
will have to be stored in a file system and will have to be loaded into the
running kernel by some user space application or script.

An important point to note in choosing if a feature should be compiled as
a module is the latency with which the feature needs to be activated from 
boot of the system. As the kernel module is stored in a filesystem, it will
not be loadable until the filesystem is mounted in the kernel.

=== Kernel Option Types

When selecting different features and configuring the kernel we come across
different types based on the information required to complete the
configuration.

bool:: _true_ or _false_ to indicate presence or absence of the feature
respectively.
tristate:: _true_ or _false_ similar to bool option types and also a third
state i.e. _module_ to indicate it is a kernel module.
int:: If an integer value is required in the configuration of the feature.
hex:: If a hexadecimal value is required in the configuration of the feature.
string:: If a string value is requried in the configuration of the feature.

=== Kernel Option Dependencies

There will be dependencies between different kernel objects. To describe
the dependency there are two types:

depends on dependencies:: The option that is dependent on another remains
invisible until the later is enabled.
select dependencies:: The option on selection automatically selects the
object on which it depends on in the configuration.
 
=== Graphical Configuration Interface _xconfig_

The xconfig configuration utitlity which uses Qt is invoked when running
_make xconfig_ in the root directory. If we try to invoke it we get the
following error:

[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~$ cd ~/Git/linux
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make xconfig

conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ 
----
<1> The target rule checks for qt
<2> A nice description of what is probably wrong with our Ubuntu distribution

Ok we need to install Qt in our system. The dependencies are _libqt4-dev_
and _g++_. For older kernel sources the dependencies are _libqt3-mt-dev_.

[source,bash]

Again we try running _make xconfig_ and see the graphical interface as shown
in the screen capture below:

====

It is possible to search for a particular feature using the search interface.
This can be invoked with a *CTRL + F* keyboard combination.

====

=== Graphical Configuration Interface _gconfig_

Another graphical interface is the _gconfig_ target.This GTK based configuration
gives the following error when we invoke it:

[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make gconfig		<1>
*
* Unable to find the GTK+ installation. Please make sure that
* the GTK+ 2.0 development package is correctly installed...

make: *** [gconfig] Error 2
----
<1> We invoke the target gconfig of the root directory makefile
<2> A helpful message indicates a missing GTK+ installation in our Ubun

In this case we have to install the debian package _libglade2-dev_

[source, bash]

=== Text Configuration Interface _menuconfig_

This configuration interface requires no graphical interface and only
requires the _libncurses-dev_ debian package to be installed. This interface
is popular with other projects such as Linux Target Image Builder (LTIB),
Busybox, OpenWrt, etc.. It works well enough for us to ignore the graphical
interfaces. It is brought up using a _make menuconfig_ command in the root
directory.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make menuconfig
----

We get the following screen shot one the interface is invoked from the shell.

====
[[beagleboneblacktux-make-menuconfig-screenshot]]
.Screenshot of menuconfig interface
image::make-menuconfig-screenshot.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/make-menuconfig-screenshot.png]
====

Searching with the _menuconfig_ interface is done by hitting the '/' key similar
to _vim_. Once the search page is displayed we can enter a key word for the
search.

====
[[beagleboneblacktux-make-menuconfig-search-imx]]
.Screenshot of menuconfig search
image::make-menuconfig-search-imx.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/make-menuconfig-search-imx.png]
====

The results of the search are displayed as follows:

====
[[beagleboneblacktux-make-menuconfig-search-results]]
.Screenshot of menuconfig search results
image::make-menuconfig-search-imx-results.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/make-menuconfig-search-imx-results.png]
====


=== Text Configuration Interface _nconfig_

Another similar test based configuration interface is _nconfig_ with the same
dependency on _libncurses_dev_ debian package. Again to invoke the interface
we will have to use _make nconfig_.

[source,bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/linux$ make nconfig
----

We get the following screen shot once the interface is invoked from the shell.

====
[[beagleboneblacktux-make-nconfig-screenshot]]
.Screenshot of nconfig interface
image::make-nconfig-screenshot.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/make-nconfig-screenshot.png]
====

=== make oldconfig

If we are upgrading to a newer release and use the _.config_ file from an older
release of the Linux kernel then we need to run _make oldconfig_. This will
inform us of the configuration settings that are irrelevant in the newer release
and if there are newer features or parameters then it will prompt us asking for
appropriate values for these settings.

Another scenario in which _make oldconfig_ may come in use is if we modify the
_.config_ file by hand.

=== Reverting To A Previous Configuration

If we mess up our configuration and build a kernel that is unusable then we can
revert to the older configuration that the kernel was built. This is done by
copyting the _.config.old_ file which gets created if we use any of the
configuration interfaces available. All the interfaces save a copy of the
existing configuration file _.config_ as a back up in _.config.old_
