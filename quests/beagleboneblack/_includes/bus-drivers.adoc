== Bus Drivers

Typically to interface the processor to any external device we would need
a bus. The bus defines an interface to communicate with other devices through
a protocol. The Linux kernel abstracts the bus as a bus driver thereby allowing
reuse of the same driver across many platforms.

There is one bus driver for each type of bus e.g. PCI, USB, SPI, I2C, etc..
So what are the functions of the bus driver?

. Regisitering the bus type i.e. _struct bus_type_.
. Registering adapter drivers which can detect devices and communicate with them
on the bus.
. Register device drivers which are to support devices connected on the bus.
. Pair devices connected on the bus with registered device drivers.

The diagram illustrates the various kernel components that enable the USB architecture to
support multiple platforms, controllers and devices. It is essentially divided into three
parts:

Core Infrastructure::
This is the main source code responsible for declaring the bus type and registering it.
. The code is defined in _drivers/usb/core_
. _struct bus_type_ is defined in _drivers/usb/core/driver.c_ and registered in
_drivers/usb/core/usb.c_

Adapter Drivers::
This is the driver code which implement the host controllers the software which is able to communicate
with the device drivers. There are several versions of the host controller which are implemented
on different platforms
. The code is defined in _drivers/usb/host_
. OHCI, UHCI, EHCI, XHCI are different host controller interfaces implemented for different platforms.
. UHCI (Universal Host Controller Interface) is an intel defined controller for USB 1.x.
. OHCI (Open Host Controller Interface) is used on systems which do not have x86 USB1.1 controllers.
. EHCI (Enhanced Host Controller Interface) was defined as a standard for USB 2.0
. XHCI (Extensible Host Controller Interface) is the latest standard which supports all USB versions
upto USB 3.1

Device Drivers::
The device drivers are spread across the kernel source code. Based on the device classification the
device driver will be present in its appropriate framework.

=== Example Of A USB Device Driver

We'll take a look at a USB network card. As it is a network device we'll be able to
find it in the network framework of the kernel source code. Since it interfaces with
the USB bus it will be a USB device driver. The driver is located at
_drivers/net/usb/rtl8150.c_.

==== Device Identification

Typically each device driver may support multiple devices. So a driver should describe
the list of devices which it supports. This is defined by a device table.

[source, c]
----
.
.
/* table of devices that work with this driver */
static struct usb_device_id rtl8150_table[] = {
        {USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_REALTEK, PRODUCT_ID_RTL8150)},
        {USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_MELCO, PRODUCT_ID_LUAKTX)},
        {USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_MICRONET, PRODUCT_ID_SP128AR)},
        {USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_LONGSHINE, PRODUCT_ID_LCS8138TX)},
        {USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_OQO, PRODUCT_ID_RTL8150)},
        {USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_ZYXEL, PRODUCT_ID_PRESTIGE)},
        {}
};

MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(usb, rtl8150_table);
.
----

The device table serves two purposes. Once the driver is loaded the USB core knows
which devices it can work with so when a device is attached to the USB bus and the core
will match the driver to that device. Another use is to extract the map between device
identifier and driver so that a dynamic loading ability is present. The _depmod_
utility can extract the module device table information which can be used by _udev_
in userspace whenever the kernel sends a notification of a new device connected.

Information about the mapping is normally present in the path
_/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.alias_ or _/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.usbmap_.

==== Driver Instantiation

To instantiate a USB device driver the core provides an API with which an
appropriate structure can be registered. This is present at the end of the file:

[source, c]
----
.
.
static struct usb_driver rtl8150_driver = {
        .name           = driver_name,
        .probe          = rtl8150_probe,
        .disconnect     = rtl8150_disconnect,
        .id_table       = rtl8150_table,
        .suspend        = rtl8150_suspend,
        .resume         = rtl8150_resume,
        .disable_hub_initiated_lpm = 1,
};

module_usb_driver(rtl8150_driver);
.
----

As mentioned before the kernel is filled with inheritance and in this case
the _struct usb_driver_ inherits a _struct device_driver_ in its definition.

==== Driver Registration And Unregistration

Now comes the part where the driver registers itself with the USB core system.
This is done in the module initialisation and exit functions. This is abstracted
through the API _module_usb_driver_. 

[source, c]
----
.
module_usb_driver(rtl8150_driver);
.
----

So if we see the definition of _module_usb_driver_ in _include/linux/usb.h_ it
turns out that it uses the generic driver registration function _module_driver_.

[source, c]
----
.
/**     
 * module_usb_driver() - Helper macro for registering a USB driver
 * @__usb_driver: usb_driver struct
 *      
 * Helper macro for USB drivers which do not do anything special in module
 * init/exit. This eliminates a lot of boilerplate. Each module may only
 * use this macro once, and calling it replaces module_init() and module_exit()
 */     
#define module_usb_driver(__usb_driver) \
        module_driver(__usb_driver, usb_register, \
                       usb_deregister)
.
----

The definition of _module_driver_ is in _include/linux/device.h_

[source,c]
----
.
/**                         
 * module_driver() - Helper macro for drivers that don't do anything
 * special in module init/exit. This eliminates a lot of boilerplate.
 * Each module may only use this macro once, and calling it replaces
 * module_init() and module_exit().
 *              
 * @__driver: driver name
 * @__register: register function for this driver type
 * @__unregister: unregister function for this driver type
 * @...: Additional arguments to be passed to __register and __unregister.
 *
 * Use this macro to construct bus specific macros for registering
 * drivers, and do not use it on its own.
 */
#define module_driver(__driver, __register, __unregister, ...) \
static int __init __driver##_init(void) \
{ \     
        return __register(&(__driver) , ##__VA_ARGS__); \
} \
module_init(__driver##_init); \
static void __exit __driver##_exit(void) \
{ \
        __unregister(&(__driver) , ##__VA_ARGS__); \
} \
module_exit(__driver##_exit);
.

In a similar fashion the adapter driver also registers itself 
with the USB core using _usb_add_hcd()_

==== Device Detection

The USB adapter driver registers itself with the USB core using the
_usb_add_hcd()_ function. The adapter driver is responsible to detect
a new device connected. It communicates the device id of the device
to the USB core. Thereafter the USB core matches the device id with
a list of known device id to driver mapping. If there is a match 
the _probe_ function of the driver is called.

==== Probing The Driver

On invoking the _probe_ function of the driver a structure is passed which is
specific to the bus interface. On invocation the driver can:

. Map I/O memory,
. Register interrupts
. Initialise private driver data structures
. Register the driver with the appropriate framework.
