== Bus Drivers

Typically to interface the processor to any external device we would need
a bus. The bus defines an interface to communicate with other devices through
a protocol. The Linux kernel abstracts the bus as a bus driver thereby allowing
reuse of the same driver across many platforms.

There is one bus driver for each type of bus e.g. PCI, USB, SPI, I2C, etc..
So what are the functions of the bus driver?

. Regisitering the bus type i.e. _struct bus_type_.
. Registering adapter drivers which can detect devices and communicate with them
on the bus.
. Register device drivers which are to support devices connected on the bus.
. Pair devices connected on the bus with registered device drivers.
