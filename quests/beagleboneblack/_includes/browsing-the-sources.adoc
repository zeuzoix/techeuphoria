== Browsing The Sources

One of the most common tasks required by any developer is the ability to browse
a project and search for:

. A specific symbol such as a function name or variable name
. The calling function of a function
. The function definition using a function call point
. An include file in the project from its declaration in source code
. A pattern of text

=== Cscope

One such tool is Cscope which allows us to browse the Linux source code with ease
from editors like vim, emacs and also independently using only cscope.

=== LXR

This is a generic indexing tool and code browser which is available as a web
service. It supports both C and C++ and it makes it easy to search for 
declarations, definitions  and symbols. A good examples of LXR with the Linux
Kernel in action is through the {uri-lxr-free-electrions}[Free Electrons LXR Site^]
and further information abouit LXR can be obtained from its
{uri-sourceforge-lxr}[sourceforge page^].
