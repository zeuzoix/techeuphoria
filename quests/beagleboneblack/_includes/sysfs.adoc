== sysfs

The _sysfs_ offers a mechanism to access the information related to 
the bus, drivers, devices, etc to the userspace. This information 
can be used to support features such as :
. dynamic loading of drivers
. dynamic loading of firmware
. automatic creation of device file

The _sysfs_ is usually mounted in _/sys/_. It is organised into different sections
of information. For instance:

. _/sys/block_ contains information of different block devices
. _/sys/class_ contains information about devices by class e.g. net, graphics, block, input, etc..
. _/sys/devices_ contains the list of devices
. _/sys/bus_ contains the list of buses

While writing a kernel module or driver we can export properties to userspace
through the _sysfs_ interface.
