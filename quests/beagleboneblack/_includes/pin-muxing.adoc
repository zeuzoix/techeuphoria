== Pin Muxing

Modern SOCs include a large number of hardware blocks but only a certain
combination of blocks can be enabled at any point in time as there are
a limited number of pins present on the SOC. In order to fascilitate the
access of hardware blocks on the SOC there needs to be some sort of
mechanism by which the system designer can select which blocks have to be
activated for the application. This is done through a software mechanism
known as _pin muxing_.

Since version 3.2 of the Linux kernel there has been a new subsystem
called _pinctrl_ which is added to handle the pinmuxing. This is
present in the _drivers/pinctrl_ section of the source code. This subsystem
provides:

. A pin muxing consumer interface for device drivers
. A pin muxing driver interface to implement the system on chip specific drivers
that configure the muxing.

Most _pinctrl_ drivers provide a Device Tree binding which must be described
in the Device Tree. The binding will differ from driver to driver but it
should be documented in _Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl_.

=== Device Tree Binding For Consumer Devices

The devices that require certains pins to be muxed will use the _pinctrl-<x>_ and
_pinctrl-names_ Device Tree properties. The _pinctrl-0_, _pinctrl-1_, pinctrl-<x>_
properties link to a pin configuration for a given state of the device.


==== Pinctrl Client Devices

Out of the following only the first is required whereas the remaining are optional:

pinctrl-0:: List of phandles, each pointing at a pin configuration
node. These referenced pin configuration nodes must be child
nodes of the pin controller that they configure. Multiple
entries may exist in this list so that multiple pin
controllers may be configured, or so that a state may be built
from multiple nodes for a single pin controller, each
contributing part of the overall configuration. See the next
section of this document for details of the format of these
pin configuration nodes.

pinctrl-1:: List of phandles, each pointing at a pin configuration
node within a pin controller.

pinctrl-n:: List of phandles, each pointing at a pin configuration
node within a pin controller.

pinctrl-names:: The list of names to assign states. List entry 0 defines the
name for integer state ID 0, list entry 1 for state ID 1, and
so on.


Taking the example given in _Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt_
under the section "Pinctrl client devices".

[source, c]
----
        /* For a client device requiring named states */
        device {
                pinctrl-names = "active", "idle";
                pinctrl-0 = <&state_0_node_a>;
                pinctrl-1 = <&state_1_node_a &state_1_node_b>;
        };

        /* For the same device if using state IDs */
        device {
                pinctrl-0 = <&state_0_node_a>;
                pinctrl-1 = <&state_1_node_a &state_1_node_b>;
        };

                pinctrl-names = "active", "idle";

                pinctrl-1 = <>;
        };

==== Pin Controller Devices

Pin controller devices should contain the pin configuration nodes that client
devices reference.

[source, c]
----
For example:

        pincontroller {
                ... /* Standard DT properties for the device itself elided */

                state_0_node_a {
                        ...
                };
                state_1_node_a {
                        ...
                };
                state_1_node_b {
                        ...
                };
        }
----

The contents of each of those pin configuration child nodes is defined
entirely by the binding for the individual pin controller device. There
exists no common standard for this content.

The pin configuration nodes need not be direct children of the pin controller
device; they may be grandchildren, for example. Whether this is legal, and
whether there is any interaction between the child and intermediate parent
nodes, is again defined entirely by the binding for the individual pin
controller device.

=== Example On OMAP / AM33xx

The base _dtsi_ file for our Beagle Bone Black is in the _arch/arm/boot/dts/am33xx.dtsi_
file. If we look at _pinctrl_ device we see that it is compatible with the _pinctrl-single_
driver. This is common between related SOCs and allows to configure pins by
writing a value to a register.

        am33xx_pinmux: pinmux@44e10800 {
                compatible = "pinctrl-single"; 	<1>
                reg = <0x44e10800 0x0238>;
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;
                pinctrl-single,register-width = <32>;
                pinctrl-single,function-mask = <0x7f>;
        };
.
.
----
<1> The compatible _pinctrl-single_ driver

The base _dtsi_ doesn't mention any _pinctrl_ configurations. We can find these _pinctrl configurations_
defined as child nodes of the main _pinctrl_ device in the board specific _dts_ file. If we search
for board files that include the base _dtsi_ file we get the following:
