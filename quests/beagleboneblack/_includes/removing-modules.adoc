== Removing Kernel Modules

We can remove a module which has been inserted and is live as part of the kernel
if no other process or kernel module is using it. To do this we have to use the
_rmmod_ utility with administrator privileges e.g. _sudo rmmod <module name>_.

Another way of removing the kernel module is with _modprobe_ e.g.
_modprobe -r <module name>_. This will attempt to remove the module and all the
dependent modules which are no longer needed after removing the module.
