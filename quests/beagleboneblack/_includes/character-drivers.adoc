== Character Drivers

As mentioned in the previous section character devices are treated
as files so the device driver for character devices must implement
the routines _open, close, read, write, etc_.

The character driver does this through the callback functions
defined in the _struct file_operations_ structure.

=== File Operations

We will take a look at the file operations for a character driver. It is not necessary
to implement either of them. These are found in _include/linux/fs.h_. The structure
below shows all operations for a file but we've enumerated the ones which are relevant
to character drivers.

[source, c]
----
struct file_operations {
        struct module *owner;
        loff_t (*llseek) (struct file *, loff_t, int);
        ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);	<1>
        ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);	<2>
        ssize_t (*aio_read) (struct kiocb *, const struct iovec *, unsigned long, loff_t);
        ssize_t (*aio_write) (struct kiocb *, const struct iovec *, unsigned long, loff_t);
        int (*iterate) (struct file *, struct dir_context *);
        unsigned int (*poll) (struct file *, struct poll_table_struct *);
        long (*unlocked_ioctl) (struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);	<3>
        long (*compat_ioctl) (struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);
        int (*mmap) (struct file *, struct vm_area_struct *);	<4>
        int (*open) (struct inode *, struct file *);	<5>
        int (*flush) (struct file *, fl_owner_t id);
        int (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);	<6>
        int (*fsync) (struct file *, loff_t, loff_t, int datasync);
        int (*aio_fsync) (struct kiocb *, int datasync);
        int (*fasync) (int, struct file *, int);
        int (*lock) (struct file *, int, struct file_lock *);
        ssize_t (*sendpage) (struct file *, struct page *, int, size_t, loff_t *, int);
        unsigned long (*get_unmapped_area)(struct file *, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned long);
        int (*check_flags)(int);
        int (*flock) (struct file *, int, struct file_lock *);
        ssize_t (*splice_write)(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct file *, loff_t *, size_t, unsigned int);
        ssize_t (*splice_read)(struct file *, loff_t *, struct pipe_inode_info *, size_t, unsigned int);
        int (*setlease)(struct file *, long, struct file_lock **);
        long (*fallocate)(struct file *file, int mode, loff_t offset,
                          loff_t len);
        int (*show_fdinfo)(struct seq_file *m, struct file *f);
};

Therefore in a character driver named _foo_ we would have the following operations
defined.

int foo_open(struct inode *i, struct file *f)::
The _open_ operation is defined so that when user space opens the device file
it gets access to the character driver. Here _struct inode_ pointer is a structure
that uniquely represents a file in the Linux system (be it a regular file,
a directory, a symbolic link, a character or block device). And _struct file_
is a structure created every time a file is opened. Going forward we see that
the _struct file_ object is used in the other operations. As the same file
can be accessed by multiple applications there needs to be a way of differentiating
each process's access. Several file structures can point to the same inode structure.
The object contains information like the current position, the opening mode, etc.
which is relevant to a particular process. The _struct file_ object also has a
_void *private_data_ pointer that one can freely use.

int foo_release(struct inode *i, struct file *f)::
The _release_ operation is called when user space closes the file.

ssize_t foo_read(struct file *f, char __user *buf, size_t sz, loff_t *off)::
The _read_ operation is defined to allow the user space application to 
read the device. So the driver has to read data from the device, write in the user
space buffer pointed _buf_ argument, and update the current position in _off_.
The pointer to the same file structure that was used in the _open_ call is used.
The amount of data should be capped to that of _sz_. The number of bytes
actually read is returned. On UNIX systems the _read_ operation blocks
if there is not enough data to read.

ssize_t foo_write(struct file *f, const char __user *buf, size_t sz, loff_t *off)::
Called when user space uses the _write()_ system call on the device
The opposite of read, must read at most _sz_ bytes from buf, write it to the device,
update _off_ and return the number of bytes written.

long foo_unlocked_ioctl(struct file *f, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)::
Associated to the ioctl() system call. Called unlocked because it didnâ€™t hold the Big Kernel Lock
(gone now). Allows to extend the driver capabilities beyond the limited
read/write API. For example: changing the speed of a serial port, setting video
output format, querying a device serial number. In this _cmd_ is a number
identifying the operation to perform _arg_ is the optional argument passed as
third argument of the _ioctl()_ system call. Can be an integer, an address, etc.
The semantic of cmd and arg is driver-specific
