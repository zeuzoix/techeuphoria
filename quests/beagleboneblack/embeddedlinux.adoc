This journal assumes you are comfortable with a linux environment as most of the
published work here uses an Ubuntu distribution as the work station.


= Introduction

[partintro]
--
This journal was started in order to document my exploration of embedded linux
using a popular low-cost platform i.e. the BeagleBone Black. The end objective 
is to become well versed with embedded linux development on an ARM based embedded
device.

= Training and Workbench Setup

[partintro]
--
This section covers the setup software and hardware used in this journal.
The sources of the training material and references are mentioned as well
as details about how to procure the hardware.

= The Kernel Source Code

[partintro]
--
This section covers details about the Linux Kernel source code. We will go through
the source code, its structure and characteristics.

= Linux Kernel Modules

[partintro]
--
This section covers details about Linux Kernel modules. Some features of the
kernel can be loaded as modules after it boots up. We will understand what a
module is and when it is used. We will also write, compile and test our very
own kernel module.

= Linux Device And Driver Model

[partintro]
--
This section covers details about the Linux Kernel device and driver model.
We will understand why we need an architecture to describe a device and its
driver. We'll see how the kernel recognises a device in the system and also
understand how it associates a driver to the device.
