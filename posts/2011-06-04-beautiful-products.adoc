Every product available today is an idea. The idea starts off as a thought
process with potential. While there are many ideas that can be turned into
products only a few actually create excitement.

Beautiful products must enhance the value of life. If a product does not
amplify its purpose and evoke euphoria it's just an unnecessary object
occupying space and time.

Simplicity, aesthetics & functionality maybe some of the qualities that
get associated with a beautiful product however these can be achieved
only through proper design and execution.

Design is the manifestation of an idea. It takes good design to push
the idea from conception to existence. For an idea to be accepted well
it has to be communicated well.

To the user a new feature adds value to the product.A well designed feature
adds weight to the acceptance of the idea and can even revolutionize the
perception of a class of products. Apple revolutionized the touch experience
and introduced its users to an experience that set the benchmark for all
smartphones.

The concept of touch was a feature that several phone manufacturers
introduced. It was only through good design that the idea moved from a
blueprint idea to a differentiating idea.

Consumers buy products and the one aspect all consumers seek is value for
money. Products don't build themselves they are developed by teams of
managers and engineers. It takes proper execution to conduct an orchestra
and produce a beautiful symphony. Likewise it also takes impeccable execution
to produce a beautiful product.

Core to execution lies effective processes and communication. While quality
is not a differentiation lack of quality will definitely downplay the expected
results. So product manufacturers should constantly look back and ask
themselves, "Is it enough?"

If a product is delivered is it enough? If a product fails to generate awe and
interest is it enough? Could better execution set the product apart from others
in its class. Execution encompasses everything from conception to realization
of the product. Beautiful products do not happen by accident they grow out of
beautiful execution.

In the end products will come and go but the beautiful ones will live on
forever at least in our memories, in case studies and museums.
