<p>So here&#8217;s the deal Facebook&#8217;s this awesome site where over 500 million users can interact with their friends and associates. Its popularity has been unchallenged leaving companies like Google and
 Microsoft sitting up and paying attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I&#8217;ve got a theory that Facebook&#8217;s banking too much on the social connection.
Facebook&#8217;s a shiny new red toy engine. It&#8217;s what everyone wants and needs to
have. But over time the red paints going to wear out and we&#8217;re going to go
after shinier toys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facebook is cool because it&#8217;s purely web based. Awesome, but to a user Facebook
offers a platform for information sharing. This information is not random,
it&#8217;s personal information. It can be a video you like, a picture you love
or just a status that makes you laugh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But here&#8217;s where I draw the line. Facebook&#8217;s not doing enough to keep me
dazzled. It&#8217;s chat doesn&#8217;t work as well as the Gmail Gtalk plugin. It&#8217;s
difficult to marshal content so as to control who views it. It&#8217;s getting
old and becoming advertising real estate which I&#8217;m not interested in.
Maybe it is useful to advertisers but from personal speak I&#8217;m not looking
at the ads. I just connect see if there&#8217;s anything interesting happening
in my social network and log off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facebook launched a new e-mail service with some yap yap difference. Well
guess what I don&#8217;t want to use the e-mail service.  Now Google&#8217;s done well
in attracting the masses away from leaders such as MSN Hotmail and Yahoo
mail by offering unlimited e-mail storage. So you&#8217;ve got you&#8217;re personal
e-mail with all your contacts located int one place and you&#8217;ve got your
social connections located in another. Interesting. You&#8217;d like to keep
the two apart because if you&#8217;re using Facebook for business you wouldn&#8217;t
want associates et al dropping in on your social life. It&#8217;s the tendency
to separate business and pleasure for fear of not being taken seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People live different lives. Not many people can safely say they&#8217;re the same
person to everyone. You&#8217;re most likely a serious person at work and a loose
fun loving beer drinking friend at parties. There&#8217;s a reason why you&#8217;re not
the same person. It&#8217;s because you live in different social circles. Within
each circle you&#8217;re a different person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facebook&#8217;s got along way to go before it can match up to my take on what the
next big thing is going to be. In this Google&#8217;s trying to claw its way up
the social curve. But Google&#8217;s got more and continuously strives to put a
fresh coat of paint on the red toy train. Google&#8217;s got millions of Gmail
users who use Android phones and growing. This is where lies the value.
You don&#8217;t talk to strangers. That contact list of yours is your social
network at least the important one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For now Facebook&#8217;s got to prove it&#8217;s improving and drawing more users to
consider it seriously. I truly hope <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" target="_blank">Mark&#8217;s</a> got an ace up his sleeve until
then I&#8217;m going to view his company as the Joker in the pack.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s something about a beautiful product. From the moment you play with it you&#8217;re hooked.You want it, you need it and you won&#8217;t rest until its yours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every product available today is an idea. The idea starts off as a thought
process with potential. While there are many ideas that can be turned into
products only a few actually create excitement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beautiful products must enhance the value of life. If a product does not
amplify its purpose and evoke euphoria it&#8217;s just an unnecessary object
occupying space and time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simplicity, aesthetics &amp; functionality maybe some of the qualities that
get associated with a beautiful product however these can be achieved
only through proper design and execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design is the manifestation of an idea. It takes good design to push
the idea from conception to existence. For an idea to be accepted well
it has to be communicated well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To the user a new feature adds value to the product.A well designed feature
adds weight to the acceptance of the idea and can even revolutionize the
perception of a class of products. Apple revolutionized the touch experience
and introduced its users to an experience that set the benchmark for all
smartphones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of touch was a feature that several phone manufacturers
introduced. It was only through good design that the idea moved from a
blueprint idea to a differentiating idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consumers buy products and the one aspect all consumers seek is value for
money. Products don&#8217;t build themselves they are developed by teams of
managers and engineers. It takes proper execution to conduct an orchestra
and produce a beautiful symphony. Likewise it also takes impeccable execution
to produce a beautiful product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Core to execution lies effective processes and communication. While quality
is not a differentiation lack of quality will definitely downplay the expected
results. So product manufacturers should constantly look back and ask
themselves, "Is it enough?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a product is delivered is it enough? If a product fails to generate awe and
interest is it enough? Could better execution set the product apart from others
in its class. Execution encompasses everything from conception to realization
of the product. Beautiful products do not happen by accident they grow out of
beautiful execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end products will come and go but the beautiful ones will live on
forever at least in our memories, in case studies and museums.</p>
