:excerpt: So you want to program the TWI/I2C interface of the AVR. Well you'll need to read up about the registers used to control this interface.
:awestruct-excerpt: {excerpt}

{excerpt} Though the microcontroller uses two pins SDA and SDC to drive the bus
there is a bunch of registers which are used to control the pins themselves. 
Let's take a look at them.

== TWI Bit Rate Register (TWBR)

This register controls the SCL clock frequency which can either be 100Hz or
400Hz.

The equation to set the correct SCL clock frequency is:

. *CPUclockfreq* is the CPU clock frequency(16MHz in my case).
. *SCLfreq* is the desired SCL clock frequency(100Hz in my case).
. *TWBR* is the value we store in the register.
. *TWPS* is the prescaler bits in the TWI status register TWSR which can take
values from 0 to 3(0 in my case).

== TWI Control Register (TWCR)

This register is used to control the operation of the TWI/I2C interface. Start
or stop a transaction and acknowledge the receipt of a data packet.

. *Bit 7 - TWINT:* Set when the TWI has finished it's task. Also used to initiate
a transaction. This flag is normally cleared by writing a 1 to it. All other
operations to the TWDR and TWAR must be done before this is cleared.
. *Bit 6 - TWEA:* Controls generation of the acknowledge bit.
. *Bit 5 - TWSTA:* Controls generation of a start bit.
. *Bit 4 - TWSTO:* Controls generation of a stop bit.
. *Bit 3 - TWWC:* This is a read only bit. It is set if you write TWDR when TWINT
is low. It is reset if you write TWDR when TWINT is high.
. *Bit 2 - TWEN:* This bit enables the TWI/I2C interface
. *Bit 0 - TWIE:* This bit in conjunction with the I-bit in SREG enables the 
interrupt mode  

== TWI Status Register (TWSR)

After every operation of the TWI interface this register is read to understand the
status of the bus.

====

. *Bits 7:3 - TWS7:TWS3:* Status of the last TWI/I2C transaction
. *Bits 1:0 - TWPS1:TWPS0:* These are the pre-scaler bits used to modify the SCL frequency.

== TWI Data Register (TWDR)  

This register is used to stores the bytes to be transmitted or the bytes received
on the TWI bus.

====

====

. *Bits 7:0 - TWD7:TWD0:* Data byte to be written to the TWI bus or read from the TWI bus. 

== TWI Address Register (TWAR)   

This register is loaded with the 7 bit Slave address to which it must respond
to when programmed as a slave or when working in a multiple master mode. In
the multiple master mode the device will compete to be a master and if it senses
that it has lost the arbitration of the line it will have to turn into a slave
and listen for a possible message from another master device.

====

. *Bits 7:1 - TWA6: TWA0:* 7 bit slave address of the TWI interface.
. *Bit 0 - TWGCE:* Indicates if the device will acknowledge a general call when 
sent. A general call is an address to all the slaves connected on the bus. The 
Slave address for a general call is usually all 0s.

In the {i2c-with-avr-register-initialization-link}[next] section I2C/TWI with AVR 
Register Intialization we'll go through the initialization code for the TWI/I2C 
interface and the values assigned to these registers.
