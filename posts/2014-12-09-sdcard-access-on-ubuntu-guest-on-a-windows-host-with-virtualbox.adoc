{excerpt}

Some of the embedded linux platforms like the
{imx28-link}[i.MX28 evaluation kit^] from {freescale-link}[Freescale] have SD
card interfaces with which a firmware image can be flashed and booted up on
the platform.

If you work in an environment where you use Microsoft Windows as your primary
OS you might end up using a Linux environment as a virtual machine on Windows.
For all work involving embedded development for your target board you will
mostly use linux based tools to build code, remote debugging or even flashing
your firmware on some sort of flash based device.

== Our Embedded Development Environment

We have a i.mx28 Evaluation Kit with a SD card interface. The platform supports
booting from firmware flashed on the SD card. In order to access the SD card we
use a linux based tool for the embedded platform. Unfortunately our linux
development machine is a virtual machine of Ubuntu running on
{virtualbox-link}[Oracle's VirtualBox^].

The challenge here is to allow the virtual machine running the guest Ubuntu OS to
recognize the SD card interface on the laptop running Windows OS as the host OS.

Specifications of the environment:

. *Host OS* : Windows 7 Professional
. *VirtualBox* : Version 4.3.8
. *Guest OS* : Ubuntu 13.04 (GNU/Linux 3.8.0-19-generic i686)

== Step 1: Accessing the command prompt on Windows 7

We'll need to access the command prompt to run VirtualBox's _VBoxManage_ utility.
In order to do so we go to _Start_ then open _Run_ and enter _cmd_ in the text
box provided.

== Step 2: Determine the physical drive number allocated to the SD Card

In our case we work with a micro SD card and have to use an adapter as shown
in the diagram below:

====

After we have plugged in our SD card we need to know what physical drive number
is allocated to it by the Windows 7 system. This will be used as a parameter to
_VBoxManage_ when we're configuring VirtualBox to use the SD card. We will use
the Windows Management Instrumentation command-line ({wmic-url}[WMIC^]) tool to determine the
physical drive.

The command might require administrator priviledges. After execution we
get to know that our SD card has been allocated a physical drive number of 1.

[source,bash]

====

== Step 3: Allowing the guest OS to access the SD card

The SD card is treated as a physical disk in the system. We need to create an
image that will represent the entire "raw disk" represented by the SD card.
To do so we will use the _VBoxManage_ utility available with the VirtualBox
installation. We first change the directory to the VirtualBox installation
path where the _VBoxManage_ utility exists. Since VirtualBox is now owned by 
Oracle it will be installed in the "Oracle" directory in "Program Files".

[source,bash]
----
C:\Users\Conrad.Gomes>cd "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox"

C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox>
----

We should now be able to create the vmdk image mapped to the SD card using
the command below. Two arguments need to be supplied, the absolute path of
the file on the host OS i.e. the Windows7 machine which will map to the SD
card and the raw disk which is expressed as "\\.\PhysicalDriveX" where "X"
is the physical drive number of the SD card that we obtained using _wmic_.

[source,bash]
----
C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox>VBoxManage.exe internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename "D:\Work\SD-Card.vmdk" -rawdisk "\\.\PhysicalDrive1"
----

If it succeeds you should see a success message as shown in the screen
capture:
