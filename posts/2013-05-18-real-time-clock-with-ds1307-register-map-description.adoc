A real-time clock(RTC) for your system can be made available using chips like 
the {ds1307-maximintegrated-link}[DS1307^]. This has the ability to be 
programmed and keep track of the time in seconds, minutes, hours and date in 
binary coded decimal(BCD) format with compensation for leap years till 2100.

The DS1307 on inspection has 8 pins. The following describes the kind of 
circuit connections required for this chip.

Starting at the top left we see pins X1 and X2 connected to a crystal. 
The crystal provides the clock to the chip and is critical in accurately 
maintaining the time once programmed. Connections for X1 and X2 is a standard 
32.768kHz quartz crystal.

The VCC and GND provide the power supply to the chip which is a 5V power 
supply.

SQW/OUT has dual functionality. It can be used to generate a square wave of
1Hz, 4kHz, 8kHz and 32kHz or it can simply output either a high or low
signal.

VBAT is the connection for an external battery. The chip has an automatic
power fail detect and switch circuitry which will switch to the battery
in the event of the main power supply failing.

SDA and SCL are the I2C lines which is used by the CPU/Micro-controller to
read and write the time and date registers.

In the next part we look at the register map of the DS1307.
