== Configuring LTIB for i.MX28

LTIB Offers a lot of flexibility in choosing the type of embedded system that
is required for the platform. Depending on the use case different aspects can
be configured using _ltib_. 

=== Selecting The Platform

On running _ltib_ it will display the ncurses dialog which is used to select
the desired platform. In our case it is Freescale iMX reference boards as shown
below:

====

.Ncurses screen with platform selection

====

On exiting it will ask you if you want to save the configuration. Make sure 
"yes" is selected and then exit:

====
[[imx28-ltib-bsp-build-freescale-ncurses-save-new-configuration]]
.Saving the new configuration

====

=== Selecting The Freescale Platform Type And Profile

It will then ask you to select the type of Freescale as i.MX28 development platform

====

Also select the package profile. We select the "Test and Development profile"

On exiting it will ask you if you want to save the configuration. Make sure 
"yes" is selected and then exit:

=== Configuring The Freescale i.MX28 Board Package

We see the ncurses configuration page for the i.MX28 board. From here the various
features of the board can be configured.
