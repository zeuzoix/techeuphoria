:excerpt: Apple announced the iBeacon format which basically makes use of the advertisement channels available in the Bluetooth LE spectrum to broadcast information about the beacon as well as data associated with the beacon. Google followed defining a backward compatible standard called Eddystone. Here are some useful links about the space in general.

== Beacon Hardware

There are several vendors and solution providers for beacons. All of them support
the iBeacon format. If you're researching the hardware required to deploy a beacon
solution then this {uri-aislelabs-hardware-report}[report^] from Aislelabs might be useful.

== About Bluetooth LE

We can't leave out understanding the basic technology that is used to deploy
the beacon solution. A good introduction to BLE can be obtained from this
{uri-argenox-intro-ble}[introduction^] given by Argenox.
