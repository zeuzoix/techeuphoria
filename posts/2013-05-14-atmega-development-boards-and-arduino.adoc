I've been going through various sources trying to figure out what the Electronic 
DIY community uses to develop {yt-led-cube}[LED cubes^], 
{yt-rc-controlled-cars}[RC controlled cars^], etc.

One of the popular micro-controllers in use today is the ATmega AVR from Atmel.
This micro-controller is also used in the popular Arduino platfrom.

The popularity of the ATmega AVR is due to the availability of free and
inexpensive development tools accelerated by the high number of development
boards available.

The  ATmega AVR was the first micro-controller to have an on board flash for
program storage. Compared to the other micro-controllers at the time which
offered one time programmable ROM, EPROM and EEPROM options. The flash offers
reduced cost of development as the frequency with which applications can
be deployed and tested easily increases.

The Arduino platform is an open source hardware and software project meant
for hobbyists, designers and artists. The hardware uses a ATmega AVR and
the software consists of an easy to use JAVA like programming IDE based
on Wiring.

I've got my hands on an AVR development board called the Device Driver Kit.
The kit can be used to learn about Linux device drivers or can be used as a
ATmega AVR development board for your electronics project.

The board has a USB interface through which you can program the ATmega 
and develop your own applications. This makes it easy to do rapid prototyping
with just a PC and the board. I'll be posting some of my side projects which 
will use the board.

It shouldn't be too difficult to whip up a ATmega AVR development board or
a Arduino board with the resources available online. However as a starting
point it would be good to familiarize yourself with the AVR before you 
jump into building your own board.
