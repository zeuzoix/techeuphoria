== Registering With Freescale

Before we proceed with the download of the source code and tools we need to
register with the {freescale-link}[Freescale^] website. After registering
with the website log on to the website with the credentials used at the time
of registeration:

== i.MX28 Software and Development Tool Resources

The development software and tools are available in the Linux section of the
i.MX28 current software releases. When writing this article the page that
was available to me had the link {imx28-sw-link}[imx28-sw-link^].

On clicking the "Linux source files" link we're taken to a license agreement.

If all goes according to plan then you should see a download of the package
{L2.6.35_1.1.0_130130_source.tar.gz-link}[L2.6.35_1.1.0_130130_source.tar.gz^]
which you can save to your linux development environment. In my case it is an
Ubuntu virtual machine running on my Windows laptop. The package download will
take some time based on your network bandwidth and speed. The size of the
package is roughly about 710MB.

== Exploring And Installing The IMX28_SW Package 

The directory L2.6.35_1.1.0_130130_source contains an install script which we run.
Before proceeding with the installation it presents the EULA which must be accepted
before installation.

[source,bash]
----

You are about to install the LTIB (GNU/Linux Target Image Builder)

Before installing LTIB, you must read and accept the EULA
(End User License Agreement) which will be presented next.

Do you want to continue ? Y|n
Y     <1>

Hit enter to continue:
IMPORTANT. Read the following Freescale Software License Agreement
.
.
----
<1> Hit 'Y' to read the EULA

At this point we have to scroll and read the EULA before it prompts us with a 
declaration stating that we have read and accept the EULA, to which we reply
"yes".

[source,bash]
----
.
.
I have read and accept the EULA (yes|no):
yes
----

Next we're asked about the installation path. We can hit "Enter" to use the default
which is _/home/ubuntu/beta/projectX/L2.6.35_1.1.0_130130_source_. However it doesn't
allow us to install it there so we supply a level above the current directory i.e.
_/home/ubuntu/beta/projectX/_.

Copying packages to /home/ubuntu/beta/projectX//ltib/pkgs

Installation complete, your ltib installation has been placed in
/home/ubuntu/beta/projectX//ltib, to complete the installation:

cd /home/ubuntu/beta/projectX//ltib
./ltib
----

The installation is completed along with a hint of the next step which is running
the Linux Target Image Builder (LTIB) tool.

== What Is LTIB?

Well LTIB is a tool which is used by Freescale to develop, build and deploy the
software i.e. bootloaders, linux kernel, applications, daemons, etc.. required to
support the board which in this case happens to be an i.MX28 board. It is uses the 
RPM way to manage software which has to be built for the target board.

It is advisable to read the Introduction and FAQ section present on the LTIB website at the following
links:

. {ltib-intro-link}[Introduction^]
. {ltib-faq-link}[FAQs^] 

== Configuring And Building LTIB

The hint given above is to configure and build LTIB. Within the configuration
various settings such as toolchain path, platform details, C library to be
used, etc can be configured.

=== Problems Running LTIB

Okay there were several issues seen while trying to install _LTIB_ on my Ubuntu 
system. We'll take a look at each one as they occurred in sequence and my steps
taken to fix all of them.

WARNING: This part will vary from system to system. It depends on your system
configuration so you may face issues different to those listed here.

==== Fixing Dependency Issues

LTIB failed and cribbed on my system complaninig about missing packages as shown
below.

Using the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) utility we are able to fix the missing
package issues. The stratedgy involves trying to identify the package
equivalent for Ubuntu using the command below.

===== Installing _zlib_

Installation of _zlib_ was not straightforward after several attempts to install
packages like _zlibc_ & _zlib-bin_ LTIB was still failing and cribbing saying
the package was missing from the system. 

Aparently all the dependencies are stored in the file _./bin/Ltibutils.pm_. So
on greping the file for zlib we get the paths which are searched for in order to
look for the zlib package.

[source,bash]
----
ubuntu@ubuntu-VirtualBox:~/beta/projectX/ltib$ grep -A 4 -B 2 zlib ./bin/Ltibutils.pm     <1>
                        `makeinfo --version 2>/dev/null`;
                    },
    zlib         => sub { my @f = (glob('/usr/lib/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/lib/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/lib64/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/usr/lib32/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so*') ); @f > 1 ? 1 : 0 },

};

sub get_ver
{
----
<1> Greping 4 lines after(-A 4) and 2 lines before(-B 2) for zlib in the file Ltibutils.pm

After doing going through some basic perl sites it was decided to print the
value of array _@f_ which was being used in the _get_ver_ function exposed
by Ltibutils.pm. The following was the change done:

[source,bash]
----
ubuntu@ubuntu-VirtualBox:~/beta/projectX/ltib$ grep -A 4 -B 2 zlib ./bin/Ltibutils.pm
                        `makeinfo --version 2>/dev/null`;
                    },
    zlib         => sub { my @f = (glob('/usr/lib/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/lib/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/lib64/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/usr/lib32/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so*') );print "Value of list = @f\n"; @f > 1 ? 1 : 0 },  <2>
    'zlib-devel' => sub { -f '/usr/include/zlib.h' },
};

{
----
<1> Greping 4 lines after(-A 4) and 2 lines before(-B 2) for zlib in the file Ltibutils.pm
<2> _print "Value of list = @f\n";_ is added

Additionally we run _ltib_ with verbose option _--verbose_ to see if we can
get any more details that can help us debug the dependency issue. This time after
we execute the _ltib_ script we get the details below:

[source,bash]

----
<1> This is the value of _@f_ which implies that our zlib library is /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libz.so
<2> This print indicates that the version obtained is -1 and hence it is forced to mark _zlib_ as not installed

The flow of calls is:

. _check_basic_deps_ in _ltib_ iterates through _$pkg_ to find each version with _get_ver_
. _get_ver_ is defined in _bin/Ltibutils.pm_ and has a series of checks for the version
.. If the $pkg is not defined in the predefined _app_checks_ it issues a
'$pkg --version 2>/dev/null' to get the package version information
.. If the $pkg is defined as 'CODE' it executes the pkg as a function call
.. Lastly it executes the value of `$app_checks->{$pkg}`
.. If _$__ is not set to anything then -1 is returned as the version

Finally after understanding the mapping of _app_checks_ for zlib it looked as
though the expression _@f > 1 ? 1 : 0 _ was evaluating to 1 instead of 2. And
this was because only one path was valid from the list of paths i.e.
_/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libz.so_. This is a softlink to the path
_/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libz.so.1.2.8_ so we add that to the list of options
available. This change is similar to  With this change the zlib dependency is
detected and the file now looks like this:

[source,bash]

                    },
    zlib         => sub { my @f = (glob('/usr/lib/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/lib/libz.so*'),
                                   glob('/lib64/libz.so*'),

{
----
<1> This is the new path added in _bin/Ltibutils.pm_
<2> This is the original path which is detected in the system. The above path is the actual file to this soft link.

We revert all changes except the fix to the original script files i.e.
_print "Value of list = @f\n";_ which was added for debugging and is not
required now.


==== Setting _sudo_ Permissions For _rpm_

The next issue was because of a test done by _ltib_ to check if there are
_sudo_ permissions for _rpm_. 

[source,bash]
----

[sudo] password for ubuntu: Sorry, try again.
[sudo] password for ubuntu: Sorry, try again.
[sudo] password for ubuntu: Sorry, try again.
sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts

This means you don't have sudo permission to execute rpm commands as root           <2>
without a password.  This is needed for this build script to operate correctly.

To configure this, as root using the command "/usr/sbin/visudo",     <3>
and add the following line in the User privilege section:

ubuntu ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rpm, /opt/freescale/ltib/usr/bin/rpm
.
.
.
----

<3> Potential fix

We can execute "/usr/sbin/visudo" as indicated or "sudo vim /etc/sudoers" is also
fine.

==== Installing The Host Support Packages

After fixing the sudo issue we run _ltib_ yet again to find a new problem as
shown below:

[source,bash]
----
ubuntu@ubuntu-VirtualBox:~/beta/projectX/ltib$ ./ltib

==== Searching For A Simpler Installation 

Aparently most of the problems seen are due to the newer version of Ubuntu of
my system. When going through the Freescale forums for similar problems a 
solution was provided in the form of a patch at
{ltib-ubuntu-patch-forum-link}[{ltib-ubuntu-patch-forum-link}^].

The temporary fix to find zlib as a dependency was removed and the patch was
installed using the steps highlighted in the forum.

===== Unpacking The Patch

The patch file has to be copied to the ltib directory and untarred there.

We see a new set of _wget_ errors this time and after searching the forums
we get help in this post about dead links in  LTIB installation.

== Conclusion Of First Failed Attempt

LTIB doesn't work without the patch from Freescale especially if you are using
a newer Ubuntu system which is greater than Ubuntu 9.0. 

Not sure about the next steps we put this attempt to rest and retry
with another attempt by applying the patch earlier on rather than later as 
a logical progression of the installation.

Sometimes it's good to erase the board and start with a fresh perspective.
