:excerpt: We now take a look at the TWI/I2C API responsible for data transfer. The header file {twi-h-link}[twi.h] has the prototype. We'll take a look at the arguments and their description now

[source,c]
----
TWI_RET_E twi_send_recv_buffer(
                           TWI_SEND_RECV_BUFFER_PARAMS_X *px_send_buffer_params,
                           TWI_MODE_E e_mode);
----

The first argument is a pointer to TWI_SEND_RECV_BUFFER_PARAMS_X defined as follows:
   
[source,c]
----
typedef struct _TWI_SEND_RECV_BUFFER_PARAMS_X
{
   uint8_t uc_dev_addr;
   uint8_t uc_dev_id;
   uint8_t *puc_reg_addr;
   uint32_t ui_reg_addr_sz;
   uint8_t *puc_data;
   uint32_t ui_data_sz;
     
}TWI_SEND_RECV_BUFFER_PARAMS_X;
----

Where

. *uc_dev_addr* is the higher nibble of the I2C slave device address
. *uc_dev_id* is the lower nibble of the I2C slave device address. It is used where the slave address can be configured
. *puc_reg_addr* is the pointer to the buffer holding the register address of the slave device.
. *ui_reg_addr_sz* is the size of the buffer with the register address.
. *puc_data* is the pointer to the data buffer
. *ui_data_sz* is the size of the data buffer.

The second argument is an enumeration which indicates if a send or receive operation is to be done
   
[source,c]
----
typedef enum _TWI_STATE_MODE_E
{
   eTWI_MODE_READ = 0,
   eTWI_MODE_WRITE,
   eTWI_MODE_INVALID
 
}TWI_MODE_E;
