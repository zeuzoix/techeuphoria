{excerpt} This is a continuation of a previous {prev-part}[post^] where we built
the 3.18 version and tested it on the BeagleBone Black.

== RT Preempt Information

Well the instructions to apply the patches is given in the
{rt-linux-wiki}[Real-Time Linux Wiki^]. It would be advisable to first go
through the {rt-linux-faqs}[FAQs^] section and get a general understanding
on RT Linux.

To apply the patches we go through the {rt-preempt-howto}[RT Preempt Howto^]
which describes the general procedure. In the document the patches are applied
on top of the vanilla kernel sources taken from
{kernel-org-link}[{kernel-org-link}. However we will have to apply the patches
on top of {robertcnelson-website}[Robert Nelson's^] bb-kernel sources for
version 3.18 which we used in the {prev-part}[previous post^].

== Locating The Correct Patches

After going through the {rt-preempt-howto}[RT Preempt Howto^], it becomes clear
that there are different patches for different versions of the kernel source at: +

{rt-patches-location}[{rt-patches-location}^]

====
[[rt-preempt-patches]]
.The patches for each kernel
image::rt-preempt-patches.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/rt-preempt-patches.png]
====

We cannot randomly apply any of the patches to our kernel source tree. We have
to find the RT-Preempt patch version which fits the kernel verison we are using.

The exact version of our kernel can be determined from the Makefile in the kernel
tree. As shown below our version is *3.18.5*.

[source, bash]
----
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/bb-kernel/KERNEL$ head Makefile 
VERSION = 3
PATCHLEVEL = 18
SUBLEVEL = 5
EXTRAVERSION =
NAME = Diseased Newt

# *DOCUMENTATION*
# To see a list of typical targets execute "make help"
# More info can be located in ./README
# Comments in this file are targeted only to the developer, do not
conrad@conrad-HP-Pavilion-dm3-Notebook-PC:~/Git/bb-kernel/KERNEL$ 
----

When we check the patches available in the _3.18_ folder of the
rt-preempt patches location we see the latest version is at *3.18.11*.

====
[[rt-preempt-patches-3point18]]
.The latest patches for 3.18 kernel
image::rt-preempt-patches-3point18.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/rt-preempt-patches-3point18.png]
====

There is a mismatch we cannot use the 3.18.11 patches as our source
code is of version 3.18.5. We take a look at the older patches in the
_older_ directory. The oldest version available is *3.18.7*.

====
[[rt-preempt-patches-3point18-older]]
.The latest patches for 3.18 kernel
image::rt-preempt-patches-3point18-older.png[width="640", height="480", align="center", link={awestruct-imagesdir}/rt-preempt-patches-3point18-older.png]
====

== Searching For A Solution

At this point we have to search for a solution as it looks like the rt-preempt
patches are not compatible with the 3.18.5 kernel. After a bit of online browsing
an answer was found on the {digi-key-eewiki-link}[wiki^] maintained by the
aplication engineers at {digi-key-link}[Digi-Key Corporation^] in the comments
page for BeagleBone Black:

{digi-key-eewiki-bbb-comments-link}[{digi-key-eewiki-bbb-comments-link}^]

[quote, John S. Rhoades]
____
I got the 3.18.5-bone1 kernel working with hard real time! I simply applied the
nearest available RT patch (patch-3.18.7-rt1.patch.xz), and by golly the patch
had no rejects and only 4 "offset x lines" messages! And the updated kernel
compiled cleanly and working right away! I really really didn't expect that.

I didn't bother to investigate the "offset" cases, since 3 of them were for
other architectures, and the other was for raid5.c, which is a module that
I don't need.

== Downloading And Applying The Patches

We will not download the patch used by John i.e. patch-3.18.7-rt1.patch.xz
instead we will download the latest real-time patch for 3.18.7 i.e.
_patch-3.18.7-rt2.patch.gz_.

[source, bash]

<1> Downloading the patch with _wget_

Now we will apply the patch on top of our _KERNEL_ as follows:

[source, bash]

<2> Apply the patch without uncompressing before applying it

<6> Raid not required

== Rebuilding After Patching

So now that the patches have been applied we will see if it has broken
our build by rebuilding the kernel as follows:

[source, bash]
----

Again we're shown the _menuconfig_ screen. Just exit and save the configuration
and let the build proceed. The build completes successfully outputing the built
binaries and archives on the console as was seen in the previous part when we
built the vanilla kernel.

=== Testing The Patched Kernel

We will follow the same steps as the part 1 section, "Testing The Kernel"
and copy the _3.18.5-rt2-bone1.zImage_ binary and the device tree binary to
the TFTP server folder to be downloaded and booted through U-Boot.

[source, bash]

<3> Copy the _am335x-boneblack.dtb_ device tree binary to the TFTP download
folder as _am335x-boneblack.3.18.5-rt2-bone1.dtb_
<4> Remove the temporary directory

==== Booting The Patched Kernel

We now boot the kernel _3.18.5-rt2-bone1.zImage_ along with the device
tree binary to see if it loads properly. We also print the version information
to make sure it gives the right string.
