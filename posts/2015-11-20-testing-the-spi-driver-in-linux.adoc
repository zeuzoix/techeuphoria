:excerpt: While working with a new board we wanted to test the SPI communications on board from user space. We knew that the SPI bus was functional because we were able to load a u-boot image from a SPI based daughter board on configuring the bootstrap settings and powering up the board. To test access we decided to write a userspace program to read the JEDEC ID of the SPI Flash chip.
