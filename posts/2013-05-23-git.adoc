{excerpt}

GIT was developed by the same team that developed Linux. Key differences as
compared to other version control systems

. Distributed: Everyone gets access to the repository on their system unlike
other version control systems which have a central repository on a server.
The main advantage being that even if network access is not available you
can still interact with the version control system.

. Snapshots: A version of a file is the snapshot of the file at that point
in time. It is not the sum of all differences. Basically the smallest unit
of change is a file.
