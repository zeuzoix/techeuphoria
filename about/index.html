<p>TechEuphoria was founded by an open source enthusiast and embedded developer,
 Conrad Gomes. The website has many purposes, however the primary
purpose is to build an engaging technical journal of experiments and
explorations of the technical kind. The author chooses open hardware and
open source software in order to promote the spirit of those who yearn to build
technology that can be made better by the contributions of those who use it.
Technology serves a higher purpose and that is, to ensure the progress and
continuance of the human species. This website stands to serve that purpose
and to hope that advancements in technology will eventually benefit the
lives of those who inhabit this blue planet.</p>

<p>The power of open source software is evident with the success of GNU/Linux
and now with the movement of open hardware coming into being we&#8217;re seeing
larger adoption of the open source paradigm in hardware design. Communities
of hackers secretly labouring at their desks building their very on boards.
The DIY movement is here to stay. Innovation is ripe and the possibilities
endless. TechEuphoria celebrates this movement and the best way to do so is
by contributing to it in the form of quests. These are technical journals
with a focus on achieving a set target. Hopefully the challenges faced and
surmounted when documented in the quests will help those who read it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The blog is a heart beat to the website. It captures a wide variety of topics
and is meant to serve as a random series of posts. The posts might be useful
tips, rants on technology, engineering processes, instructions and recipes on
how to do something that the author has found useful. It will also serve
as a news feed about important changes on the website. The author initially
maintained a simple blog at <a href="http://techeuphoria.blogspot.in">Techeuphoria</a>. It was in
working with the blog that the idea of creating an independent website
originated. And so all the posts have since being imported to TechEuphoria.</p>

<p>In the end TechEuphoria is what you make of it. It represents a quest in itself
to Conrad Gomes. The very existence of this site is proof that it is a brave new
world and if you really want to do something you can do it yourself. There is
only one skill needed to survive in the new world and that is, to hack anything
and everything.</p>
